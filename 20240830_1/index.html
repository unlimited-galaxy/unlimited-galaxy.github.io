I want to know what the fandom though that time about ryuseitai’s future before !! even existed, and Yesss I saw the Midochia content from back then and the possibility of Chiaki being a solo idol and Midori being like &quot;I want to see him more 🥺&quot;~ I arrived quite late to the fandom so I’m curious about the thoughts of someone who loves Ryuseitai and Midochia and had the opportunity to live that 👀</p></blockquote><p>a continuation of <a href="/20240824_1" target="_blank">this curiouscat question</a>. <a href="https://x.com/0918justice/status/1829637904408215554" target="_blank">tweet link of the answer</a></p><span id="more"></span><p>thank you for the clarification!! let’s see then… okay, so note that this is the sort of stuff you would’ve come across mostly pre-meteor impact (april 2019), so from 2015 to late 2018. these still existed in 2019 somewhat but, it’s also when hapiele announced the timeline will potentially advance so it was more like &quot;panic&quot; era LOL (since &quot;oh god everything we’ve known is going to change&quot; was a common thought)</p><p>so! headcanons fans would have about ryuseitai’s future were stuff like:</p><ul><li><p>ryusei red tetora, being a leader, being on stage with midori and shinobu by his side, having his own juniors, etc</p></li><li><p>some kind of &quot;passing on the ryusei red jacket to tetora&quot; special moment between chiaki and tetora post-repayfes, like during graduation or other. i vaguely remember there being a lot of fanart like that whenever it was graduation season</p></li><li><p>graduation ideas Everywhere and especially when graduation season comes about. stuff like how the juniors would cry as they see off their seniors, chiaki passing on something of his to one of them (like his green tie to midori for example)</p></li><li><p>&quot;how would tetora, midori, and shinobu act as the senpais for their new members&quot; kind of ideas. tetora being seen as reliable and confident and super cool, midori and shinobu as bashful but do their best, especially to support tetora. also all of them having juniors that go kyaa over how cool and handsome they are. i feel like i vaguely remember an idea that explores the new ryusei black member (a new junior) and tetora talking to that member about his own experiences to encourage him… but maybe i’m making shit up</p></li><li><p>tetora getting leader advice from chiaki by calling him or meeting up with him. chiaki sharing a part of himself with tetora whenever tetora starts to struggle as a leader. ok actually i can’t remember how many people thought that up, that was just my headcanon</p></li><li><p>also something that was more my headcanon but it probably did exist in other people’s minds too, but i headcanonned that ryuseitai got a huge load of juniors because they all felt inspired by ryuseitai and wanted to be heroes too, and it was one of the struggles tetora went through at first but overcame with the help and support of midori and shinobu. with chiaki offering to help but tetora tells him it’s ok he’ll figure it out</p></li><li><p>tetora who’s taller and got ear piercings in his 3rd year, midori who’s grown taller too and even picked up modeling, shinobu who’s still the same height more or less but more handsome</p></li><li><p>ryuseitai juniors catching up with their ryuseitai seniors in a monthly get-together or something similar to that. or even half-yearly sometimes because chiaki’s usually headcanonned to be very busy with work</p></li><li><p>chiaki was headcanonned as someone who becomes part of the acting and/or modeling showbiz after graduation, instead of an idol. chiaki appearing in his dream toku shows, in tv shows in general etc and becoming an action star</p></li><li><p>kanata’s post-grad headcanons ranged from going into showbiz, to not doing anything related to showbiz, to even ideas about kanata disappearing post-grad and people trying to find him again. chiaki sometimes had &quot;disappears after graduation and people try to find him&quot; concepts too though</p></li><li><p>sometimes chiaki and kanata were headcanonned to live in the same apartment building, but most times it was them living in their own apartments. sometimes also as them partnering up for jobs together because of that &quot;kamen rider no.1 and no.2&quot; chiaki line from climax</p></li><li><p>most common headcanon was that all of them would no longer see themselves as part of ryuseitai once they graduate. so even when the juniors graduate they see themselves as just having their own careers right now, and that once upon a time they were &quot;ryusei (color)&quot;. but they’d still reference their ryusei color like &quot;i’m the green of compassion after all, even if i’ve graduated/retired from that&quot; kind of thing</p></li><li><p>ryuseitai doing a small ryuseitai live for nostalgia and as a reunion with their fans and each other. sometimes depicted as when the juniors are still in their 3rd year, but most times it’s set after they’ve graduated and now all adults. i remember sometimes seeing fans dub it &quot;neo ryuseitai&quot; in their fanworks (i headcanonned it with a similar name too)</p></li><li><p>chiaki always tearing up when he meets them again and sees how much they’ve grown</p></li><li><p>not sure about tetora and shinobu’s commonly headcanonned post-grad careers (other than &quot;go into showbiz&quot;) but for midori, other than showbiz, another was modelling, and another was him quitting being an idol and inheriting the greengrocer shop</p></li></ul><p>climax set the tone for a lot of these headcanons i listed. sadly, i didn’t explore that many headcanons that existed before climax since i came pretty late into 2016, and climax was released early 2017… but whenever i’d read 2015/2016 midochia fics set in the future, there would be plenty of headcanons about midori’s development and how he’d grow. even pre-climax there were a lot of ideas about how he wants to work hard for ryuseitai, he wants to repay them (especially chiaki) for giving him confidence in himself… stuff like that!!</p><p>not THAT related to post-grad headcanons but i may as well share for being such an old beautiful relic… there was even a famous MMD exploring midori’s development just months before climax. i rewatched it now after so long and it’s still soooo sweet, so i’ll share it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10I48afjstuSOht_R5muG1iqCFzCJKLk7OblbaWPYoWc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here with the translation</a>! (which i translated long ago when it first came out, and cleaned it up just now for this ask LOL)</p><p>i think there’s a few more but these are the common ones i could remember… it’s pretty interesting to list them now after so long, with all the things we learn in !! era LOL i personally held a LOT of these headcanons too and would daydream a lot about different things to do with their future… it was a very fascinating topic to think about back then… thank you for asking!! let me know if there’s still something else you wanted to know!!</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Question-and-Answer/" rel="tag">#Question and Answer</a></div></footer></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy; <span itemprop="copyrightYear">2025</span> <span class="with-love"><i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i> </span><span class="author" itemprop="copyrightHolder">Unlimited Galaxy</span></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animejs@3.2.1/lib/anime.min.js" integrity="sha256-XL2inqUJaslATFnHdJOi9GfQ60on8Wx1C2H8DYiN1xY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/comments.js"></script><script src="/js/utils.js"></script><script src="/js/motion.js"></script><script src="/js/next-boot.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-generator-searchdb@1.4.0/dist/search.js" integrity="sha256-vXZMYLEqsROAXkEw93GGIvaB2ab+QW6w3+1ahD9nXXA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/third-party/search/local-search.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quicklink@2.2.0/dist/quicklink.umd.js" integrity="sha256-4kQf9z5ntdQrzsBC3YSHnEz02Z9C1UeW/E9OgnvlzSY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script class="next-config" data-name="quicklink" type="application/json">{"enable":true,"home":true,"archive":false,"delay":true,"timeout":3000,"priority":true,"ignores":"/\\/categories\\/?/, /\\/tags\\/?/,","url":"https://unlimited-galaxy.github.io/20240830_1/"}</script><script src="/js/third-party/quicklink.js"></script></body></html>
