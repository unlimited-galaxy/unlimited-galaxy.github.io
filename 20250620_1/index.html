itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>helloo what are your thoughts on submarine midori/the rest of rst because personally it was so painful to read how everyone was treating chiaki... even considering rst's tsundere schtick to chiaki, submarine's teasing? felt a lil bit too harsh. especially when at the start of the story they (midori/tetora) were talking abt how nice it is to have chiaki as leader again, but then they turn up on him??</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>my shipper lens wants to believe it's just midori upset with chiaki's orders and upset that he has to go away sometimes idk ive no other way to rationalize their hostility towards chiaki</p></blockquote><p><em>Sent and answered in June 2025.</em> <a href="" target="_blank">tweet link of the answer</a></p><span id="more"></span><p><a href="TBA" target="_blank">TBA</a></p><p>i have soooo many thoughts on this, because prior to supervillain's release, i was also Extremely Confused what submarine was trying to say... until supervillain came out and answered every question and confusion i had. so i'll try to break this down as much as possible, with a focus on midochia since it was explicitly mentioned in this ask. this is gonna be a long one because submarine is an easy to misunderstand story, even after we finally got the context to the story.</p><p>to begin, submarine is part of the SS main story and its story purpose is mainly to illustrate ryuseitai and akatsuki's SS qualifying round. ryuseitai essentially navigate through the plot while still having their own issues to deal with. this is why submarine can't be read on its own as a <em>ryuseitai</em> story, or with the intention to &quot;learn about where ryuseitai's headed&quot;.</p><p>to put it in another way, submarine's purpose isn't to specifically <em>understand</em> the tense times in ryuseitai's arc, it's to <em>see</em> what was happening during that tense time. even at the time of its release in 2021, it was an extremely difficult story to understand in terms of ryuseitai's storyline because we didn't have the context of <em>why</em> ryuseitai was THIS strained, so understanding submarine on its own WITHOUT other stories is not possible. it's also a story that doesn't even end on a conclusion for ryuseitai per se. for an actual conclusion to what we learn in submarine, stories like supervillain and stella maris are must-reads. motor show and comet show are also EXTREMELY essential to understanding submarine, ESPECIALLY as a reminder that there is NO hatred towards chiaki, nor is submarine about retaliation or hostility. motor show is explicitly about how much tetora and chiaki care about each other, for example.</p><p>i'm mentioning this because it's the Key to understanding the strained parts in submarine. now that we have the full ES!! year 1 arc laid out, submarine acts like a peek into how ryuseitai operated during the overarching plot (whether the main plot or their own arc) <em>even</em> when things were really strained for them.</p><p>other things i'd like to note:</p><ul><li><p>it's best to separate how ryuseitai treat chiaki into their own separate things. tetora and midori's attitude towards chiaki isn't a full on reflection of how ALL of ryuseitai treat him. shinobu has always been amicable with chiaki and it's a big reason why chiaki grew to trust shinobu no matter what (and became a huge plot point in supervillain).</p></li><li><p>even how tetora and midori treat chiaki is NOT a tag-team against him, they also have their own seperate reasons for acting that way towards him.</p></li><li><p>submarine is much more serious in nature, especially with the interactions between the ryuseitai members (hell, at one point one of the jokes in the story is that this isn't the time to make dumb jokes). there is no &quot;tsundere shtick&quot; or anything of the sort with how they're speaking to each other, they clashing with one another.</p></li><li><p>submarine is a REALLY GOOD story to show ryuseitai members weaknesses AND strengths, all packed in one. and weaknesses will tend to show genuine flaws, but in seeing their flaws we get to know their strengths and <em>how</em> they make up for each other's shortcomings.</p></li><li><p>ALL of what is happening within ryuseitai is out of <strong>love</strong> for each other, even during their strained times.</p></li></ul><p>now, i'll break it down one by one. i'll start with the easiest as it's explained very well across all the stories: tetora</p><h2 id="tetora-s-attitude-towards-chiaki">tetora's attitude towards chiaki</h2><p>when submarine first came out, i also didn't fully understand why tetora was acting that way. i thought they had all agreed to following the agency's order and returning back to the 5 of them at the end of comet show, so tetora's attitude in submarine confused me.</p><p>i'll be completely honest and say that i NEVER understood it at all and it felt contradictory to me based on comet show and motor show... and i gave up understanding for 2 years... until supervillain came out and <strong>perfectly illustrated exactly what the actual problem was.</strong> FROM THE VERY FIRST START WITH THE PROLOGUE.</p><p>as i've said, submarine does <em>not</em> provide context, it is a PEEK into how they were doing once things became strained. so what exactly even made things strained in the first place?</p><p><a href="http://310mc.github.io/supervillain/prologue" target="_blank">supervillain's prologue</a> is a look into what had happened RIGHT after comet show ended, and we learn so much.</p><ul><li><p>firstly, tetora's not mentally doing well, and it's causing him to make careless mistakes. a fatal mistake he does here is accidentally genuinely punch chiaki when they were only supposed to act out a scene for a show</p></li><li><p>this punch genuinely physically affects chiaki, which is indicated by how 1: panicked kanata was (kanata is almost NEVER panicked in any ryuseitai story), 2: he needed to go to the infirmary for a check-up</p></li><li><p>just after chiaki gets punched, chiaki tries to put up a strong front and make a joke out of the situation to brighten up the mood, even though everyone's panicked (and he himself is surely shaken up by it too, since he's actually not that physically strong at all). and this is where everything snowballs:</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> Fuhaha! Nagumo, you little clutz…☆</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tetora (slouched down and looking sad):</strong> ……………</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> You making a mistake in estimating distance is such a rare sight, since you’re so good at karate!<br>No, actually, I should’ve realized that it would hit me and dodged in time!<br>My reflexes didn’t react fast enough! I’m so sorry!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> Why ar—</p></blockquote><p>note that chiaki interrupted tetora, and adds in an apology (for what? HE'S the one who got punched!). he then continues to talk even more:</p><blockquote><p>Nagumo, I don’t blame you for this, but you haven’t been getting much sleep lately, have you? I can see you’ve got dark eyebags.<br>Exactly befitting of Ryusei Bla— Ah, um, anyway, you should take good care of yourself!<br>...[dialogue cut short, him saying he'll go get a physical check-up in an energetic tone]<br>But before I go, I just want to say: don’t fret over it, Nagumo. I’ll be fine. Accidents like this happen all the time.<br>Injuries can occur even in pro-wrestling, where a script is always prepared. It’s the same when rehearsing and acting for tokusatsu shows. After all, even if it’s a play, you’re still fighting with your actual body.<br>You did nothing wrong, Nagumo.<br>Rather, and I say this again, I’m sorry I couldn’t foresee the accident to avoid it in time.</p></blockquote><p>tetora points out the elephant in the room; which is that he <strong>genuinely did mess up, though.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> Why—… are you apologizing…<br>That was obviously all my fault. I’m the <em>only</em> one who made a mistake here. Actually… not just this, but everythin’ else, too.<br>The reason Ryuseitai got into this unnatural state—<br>Is all ‘cuz I was weak, isn’t it? Every single thing’s all on me.</p></blockquote><p>main problem is... because tetora's not doing mentally well, it's covered with all the crippling self-esteem that's been worsening, and he instead just takes ALL the blame on himself. this is what makes chiaki escalate his words even further:</p><blockquote><p>No, that isn’t true at all. As I said on stage at Comet Show, I take full responsibility.<br>I was naïve in my foresight. Because of that, I failed to give everyone the future they wanted. I couldn’t even push the agency, the higher-ups’ demands, out of our way.<br>I’m the one at fault, and I’m also the one who’s weak.<br>So… Don’t make that sad face, Nagumo.</p></blockquote><p>here's where it becomes more obvious chiaki isn't doing well either after comet show, but also, nothing makes him feel even <em>worse</em> than seeing someone he loves feeling sad, so he keeps going and going with this argument because he can't stand to see tetora upset with himself:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> I’m horrible for doing that. I shouldn’t ever be forgiven.<br>I betrayed your trust, trampled on your dreams and efforts, and hurt you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> I’m not a single bit hurt from that, though. It’s true that I was disappointed that I had to step down as the leader, but…<br>That was all ‘cuz I wasn’t good enough. If this outcome’s what the higher-ups and society want, then there’s not much I can do ‘bout it.</p></blockquote><p>note that tetora <strong>makes it explicitly clear that it is not the final events of comet show that he's hurt by</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> That’s why I accept things as is. Even if I really <em>was</em> a li’l hurt by all’a this, the punch just now made up for it, so it’s fine.<br>With that, we’d have hurt each other the same amount, and we can call it even.</p></blockquote><p>note again that tetora is simply giving a hypothesis that even if say he <strong>does</strong> have a bit of hurt inside, then it's been evened out through that punch, so it doesn't matter anyway. but again, tetora is still blaming himself instead of the target chiaki is clearly telling him to blame (which is to blame HIM, chiaki) and that makes chiaki go off one more time until...</p><blockquote><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> …Except, what I took from you doesn’t even compare with that one punch you threw on me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tetora, visibly showing anger:</strong> What’s <em>with</em> you? I <em>just</em> said that I accept the situation as it is. Yet you keep persistin’ otherwise, over and over and over again—</p></blockquote><p>it escalates horribly to the point the rest of ryuseitai chime in panicked at where the discussion has gone.</p><p>from this chapter alone, we learn that:</p><ul><li><p>chiaki and tetora are NOT mentally doing well, and they're not coping with it well either. because they're not mentally doing well, a clash happens between them</p></li><li><p>EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TETORA'S MISTAKE, chiaki INSISTED it is all his fault, and for tetora not to take the blame because he did nothing wrong</p></li><li><p>even when tetora expresses himself and clarifies a little more on how he actually feels (for example, that he <em>isn't</em> upset by the comet show decision), chiaki immediately counter-argues that it still doesn't mean it's his fault, and he should put all the blame on him for not having taking enough responsibility, etc.</p></li><li><p>chiaki's insistence is where tetora snaps, because nothing he's saying is getting through to chiaki. chiaki is completely ignoring his words to shut the conversation down with &quot;it's my fault, you did nothing wrong, don't blame yourself, i deserved that punch and more actually, so don't be sad nagumo&quot; when, again, let's not forget it is <em>tetora's mistake</em> that chiaki got hurt.</p></li></ul><p>the rest of supervillain continues to illustrate these aspects of their relationship, especially for chiaki, who continues to not really be doing that mentally well in the first few chapters of supervillain up until he meets with tetora.</p><p>now, i absolutely don't think tetora is at fault here, he was clearly mentally not doing well and that's what caused him to accidentally hit chiaki. but it is OBJECTIVELY true that even if it's a MISTAKE, tetora hit chiaki.</p><p>so when i first read this chapter when the story came out, watching chiaki try so hard to argue against tetora that No Actually, It Makes Perfect Sense That Happened Because I Was Too Careless Also I Deserved That, made <em>EVERYTHING</em> between these two in submarine click in my head. no WONDER tetora was acting that way with chiaki! by the time submarine had happened (which was in winter), he must've just given up entirely with having any conversation with chiaki because he knows it won't go anywhere, chiaki will just make it all about how it's HIS fault and HE should be the one to blame for things that TETORA is personally going through.</p><p>but at the same time, i don't think chiaki is at fault either, he was also not doing mentally well, and he only spirals further when the people he loves aren't doing well. but it's objectively true that chiaki has a <em>very</em> awful habit to insist that the blame is all put on him whenever his beloved one's are upset or clashing with each other. he did this during the argument between midori and tetora in climax too, where he simply did a terrible job at defusing the situation by sacrificing himself:</p><blockquote><p>Nagumo! Takamine! Sengoku! Hit me! If you have any problems, then hit me with every one of them right here, right now! Beat me up as you please!<br>I’ll be fine! I’m used to getting hurt! But I can’t bear to watch you fight and hurt each other!<br>The pain is worse than dying! It would be less painful if you just hit me instead!<br>I’ll take all your anxiety, your pain — everything! And then I'll toss it all into the sun, causing a huge explosion, and we'll then have our happy ending!</p></blockquote><p>(note: to him, this was still an attempt to <em>not</em> interfere with their fight and to still let them grow. by taking on their negative feelings.)</p><p>submarine acts as a peek to see how tetora navigates that frustration he has with chiaki, all the while he has a very awful crippling self-esteem he's trying to work through. remember, he now knows there's no point talking it out with chiaki because chiaki will just shut him down by saying it's &quot;my fault everything happened&quot;.</p><p>this frustration kind of leaks out and sort of &quot;taints&quot; the other feelings he has for chiaki. where he felt a lot of admiration for chiaki, he instead feels upset chiaki takes &quot;everything he ever wanted&quot;. where he felt a lot of care for chiaki, he's upset he can't even express that before chiaki shuts him down again. where he felt a lot of pride and joy to be part of ryuseitai and to be the one to uphold the legacy chiaki left behind, he's frustrated that he can't contribute to the unit as much as he had hoped now that chiaki's the leader and takes over everything (due to him feeling like he's responsible for everything). he's frustrated that he wants to show he's grown, but with how insistent chiaki is to &quot;take away&quot; the negative feelings from tetora, he feels pampered and treated like a little kid who needs protection (and tetora has a huge complex with being treated like a kid).</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Question-and-Answer/" rel="tag">#Question and Answer</a></div></footer></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy; <span itemprop="copyrightYear">2025</span> <span class="with-love"><i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i> </span><span class="author" itemprop="copyrightHolder">Unlimited Galaxy</span></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animejs@3.2.1/lib/anime.min.js" integrity="sha256-XL2inqUJaslATFnHdJOi9GfQ60on8Wx1C2H8DYiN1xY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/comments.js"></script><script src="/js/utils.js"></script><script src="/js/motion.js"></script><script src="/js/next-boot.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-generator-searchdb@1.4.0/dist/search.js" integrity="sha256-vXZMYLEqsROAXkEw93GGIvaB2ab+QW6w3+1ahD9nXXA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/third-party/search/local-search.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quicklink@2.2.0/dist/quicklink.umd.js" integrity="sha256-4kQf9z5ntdQrzsBC3YSHnEz02Z9C1UeW/E9OgnvlzSY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script class="next-config" data-name="quicklink" type="application/json">{"enable":true,"home":true,"archive":false,"delay":true,"timeout":3000,"priority":true,"ignores":"/\\/categories\\/?/, /\\/tags\\/?/,","url":"https://unlimited-galaxy.github.io/20250620_1/"}</script><script src="/js/third-party/quicklink.js"></script></body></html>
