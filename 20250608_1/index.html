itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>Question! Don’t remember if you answered this before or if you were even part of the Enstars fandom back then, back the Crossroad event was the one that first revealed Chiaki wears glasses (and showed his meeker personality) right? If you were already in the fandom then, do you happen to remember how fans reacted to that? I imagine it caused quite a bit of chaos (affectionate) among ChiakiPs 😂</p></blockquote><p><em>Sent in September 2024, answered in June 2025</em></p><p><a href="" target="_blank">tweet link of the answer</a></p><span id="more"></span><p>i was There. it was indeed The Event to reveal something so mindblowingly New and Unimagined about chiaki, which is so bizarre to think about now like, wow… it’s practically the Norm now to know chiaki used to be so meek and wear glasses all the time, thanks to meteor impact.</p><p>ok, this requires SO MUCH CONTEXT BEFORE I GET TO THE FANDOM’S REACTION. there are layers to this (kinda)</p><h1>theories about past chiaki</h1><p>prior to crossroad, fans had their own theories what sort of person chiaki was pre-3rd year. a lot of it was based on the very little we know, which is:</p><ul><li>kuro mentioning that midori is similar to past chiaki (said right after midori was being meek and scared in front of kuro) (tough guy)</li><li>chiaki mentioning he used to cry a lot when he first started out as a leader (christmas live)</li><li>chiaki mentioning how he struggled so much that at one point, seeing the color red made him sick, also mentioning he used to cry himself to sleep (climax)</li><li>kanata mentioning chiaki saved him and taught him many things (scroll of the elements)</li><li>how desolate ryuseitai was back then and how it affected chiaki (wisteria), and chiaki saying he was in ryuseitai to benefit off of it (climax)</li></ul><p>some of these made people go &quot;WHAT DOES IT MEAN…???&quot; but some were Just Enough to make up theories and think up ideas of how past chiaki must’ve been like.</p><p>past chiaki fanworks would range in various ways, but i'd say the two main ways is either &quot;how did kanata and chiaki meet&quot; (based on any hints the two spoke of about each other) or &quot;depressed/meek chiaki&quot; (based on the concerning things chiaki has said about his past self). the former was a lot more focused on illustrating how the two met and how chiaki invited kanata over to ryuseitai, so it wouldn't necessarily depict chiaki depressed or meek, but the latter was ALL about that, so there were some extremely depressing fanworks back in the day of 1st or 2nd year chiaki having depressing/anxious thoughts, of him legitimately crying himself to sleep, etc.</p><p>there was one theory that wasn't common at all, but i was a huge fan of and would hunt down for anyone who saw the vision, and it's ryusei green chiaki. this one is obviously Very Fixated on the tough guy hint, where kuro notes midori reminds him of past chiaki, and chiaki immediately tries to change the subject. i was really obsessed with this idea because the depressed/crying chiaki hints gave me life back then and i was hungry for ryuseitai reminiscence because i Wanted to die by the angst (this is funny in retrospect because when meteor impact finally came out years later i legitimately became emotionally broken by the heaviness of that story LMFAO. be careful what you wish for !)</p><p>and there was another past chiaki theory that was debunked mid of 2016 when element came out: ex-fine!chiaki. i came into the fandom late 2016, so i wasn't really here for the craze of this theory nor how it felt to see it get debunked, but it sure existed (because eichi called chiaki by his first name) and also explored this idea of a depressed/unsure chiaki being part of a &quot;justice&quot; unit that doesn't feel like the real justice he wants. i talk in more detail about eichi/chiaki relationship theories prior to the hospital friends reveal in <a href="/20240208_1" target="_blank">this ask</a> for anyone curious!!</p><p>SO personally, that was my experience back then before crossroad came out. i was consuming any and all depressed past chiaki fanworks i came across, and chiakiP at the time were also very invested in the hints chiaki mentioned about his past self.</p><p>and no matter how different people approached it, all these theories and delusions had one thing in common: none of them depicted chiaki with a different appearance in any way, since none of the hints implied that he might've looked different</p><h2 id="crossroad-event-preview">crossroad event preview</h2><p>there's one more important thing to mention before i get to the fandom's reaction. in 2017, we were hit with insane emotional rollercoasters one after the other. setsubun, four beasts of fistfighting, and climax were big ones for fans of 1st year characters, but suddenly a month later we finally get a new reminiscence... FOR TRICKSTAR. the sudden resurgence of reminiscence stories made the fandom go wild, wondering if we're getting any other past stories this year.</p><p>suddenly we get a new character, The Mikejima Madara Himself, and now ryuseitai fans are going insane because MADARA WAS MENTIONED IN CLIMAX AS AN EX-RYUSEITAI MEMBER. DOES THIS MEAN RYUSEITAI REMINISCENCE IS UPON US SOON!? then wisteria (madara's introduction story) comes out and REVEALS MORE INSANE SHIT ABOUT PAST RYUSEITAI, PAST CHIAKI AND KANATA, AND THAT MADARA AND KANATA ARE CHILDHOOD FRIENDS???? shit was so wild in 2017!!</p><p>personally, i was going even MORE insane about all the theories and possibilities of past ryuseitai after madara came out, wondering what color madara could've been <em>if</em> chiaki was ryusei green. and chiaki being so meek and self-deprecating around madara fueled me to keep up the ryusei green chiaki theory. wisteria also has a scene that makes it sound like <em>madara</em> was the reason ryuseitai fell apart in the past, so THAT was fun to think about too. (note, this ends up being heavy unreliable narration from the characters since meteor impact reveals otherwise). but that was just me, for the fandom they were still mostly like &quot;W-WAIT COULD WE BE NEXT IN LINE FOR A REMINISCENCE STORY...??&quot;</p><p>well lucky for the fandom because 1 month later IT WAS <strong>THE</strong> CHECKMATE. fans are now going fucking crazyyyyy. people are either dying by checkmate, or starting to list off what other things we could get reminiscence of, like deadmans, the other eccentric's battles in the war, ryuseitai, etc... particularly ryuseitai, because madara was in checkmate and ryuseitai was mentioned a bit so it was like UMMM...???? ARE WE SOON...???</p><p>so by this point, people were expecting more and more reminiscence stories because it seemed like a &quot;pattern&quot;. and so, when people waited on july 27th for the next event preview, it was both super hype that it's yet another reminiscence for the month AND... THE APPEARANCE OF 2ND YEAR KEITO AND IN DEADMANS, NO LESS. THE MEGANE TEMPLE GUY LOOKING ALL LIKE <em>THAT</em>. honestly crossroad keito's reveal had its own interesting reactions, but i'm not keitoP so it's sadly very badly documented on my old twitter. all i know is apparently according to my tweets, we had already known a deadmans song was gonna be released with the undead CD by this point (i don't remember through what, because i can't find what deadmans song announcement had happened before crossroad event), so that's why it made sense that it'd be a deadmans reminiscence event.</p><p>anyway, crossroad event has been previewed. since the high rarity cards were keito, rei, koga and kuro, people assumed it's going to have all the undead and akatsuki members in the story. but that only adds up to 7 cards, and events back then <em>always</em> at least had 8 cards released per event. and back then you HAD to wait for gacha/event release to know all the cards. it wasn't like how it is now where they just post all the cards of each new content.</p><p>so now, there are theories of who the last 3* could be. i don't remember people's speculations, but mine at the time were madara, eichi, ritsu, or kanata. madara because he was being inserted in every story back then probably to get him caught up with the other characters + his relations with keito and rei were established by this point. eichi because it's eichi. ritsu because of rei, and kanata because of the hints in scroll of the elements that keito and kanata had some sort of beef in the past. note how there is 0 chiaki speculation in here, despite how excited and obsessed i was with past chiaki...❤️</p><p>things are calm between the preview and the event story release on july 31st. hinata was the gacha for crossroad, and tetora was a 3* card in it, and i tweeted this at the time: &quot;anyway august just started and ryuseitai member got a new card so that silence for half a month was nice while it lasted&quot; (They Don't Know.) i was just tweeting random shit, posting random screenshots, until.... it was The Day Of The Event.</p><h2 id="crossroad-event-release">crossroad event release</h2><p>as soon as the event started, i opened the event rewards to see who the last 3* was (the usual way people would show who the 3*s were for an event back then), and i'm just gonna post the tweets at the time because i think they speak for themselves:</p><img src="/img/images/crossroadreaction.jpg"><p><big>&quot;HE WAS A NERD?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?&quot;</big></p><p><big>&quot;I CAN'T BELIEVE CHIAKI WAS A MEGANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;</big></p><p>the entire TL fucking broke apart. the whole story was released at once, so everyone was dying for several different reasons. the depressing story, the reveal of how the characters looked back then, their casual outfits, everything had some reaction to Something in the story.</p><p>my first reaction, as well as some others' first reaction? Well:</p><style>.group-picture .group-picture-column{flex:none}</style><div class="group-picture"><div class="group-picture-row"><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/b/b6/%28Soothing_Holiday%29_Midori_Takamine.png" alt=""></div><div class="group-picture-column"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/7/77/%28Practice_of_Justice%29_Chiaki_Morisawa.png" alt=""></div></div></div><p><strong>guys.</strong> (still relevant to this day btw He He He He...)</p><p>as someone who was insanely obsessed with the idea of ryusei green chiaki, this was CRAZY. THE IDEA THAT ENSTARS WOULD ACTUALLY???? RELATE CHIAKI TO GREEN IN SOME WAY, EVEN IF IT'S JUST HIS CASUAL OUTFIT??? i was broken. not to mention i fucking LOVE nerd megane characters (enstars initially piqued my interest because of keito being the ultimate megane anime boy trope), so it felt like fate for my favorite character to actually be a megane all along.</p><p>and then came in everyone's theories of what this could mean about his eyesight... does this mean current chiaki wear contacts? did he only wear them to avoid standing out? IS HE JUST THAT MUCH OF THE NERD TROPE ALL ALONG!? there were memes just as much as there were genuine attempts to figure out what this means about 3rd year chiaki. by this point, stories did make it more clear that chiaki isn't <em>actually</em> an idiot, but he was still mostly seen as &quot;the idiot hot-blooded hero&quot; by the fandom, so the thought he could actually be The Nerd Megane Trope was mindblowing.</p><p>checkmate had a surprising megane reveal too, that revealed arashi used to wear glasses... but it did give an explanation of why in the story (she was imitating akiomi), so chiakiP wondered if it's possible chiaki's reasoning could be something similar (i.e. purely temporary thing he had done for a very specific reason, rather than because his eyesight's bad. hence some people wondering if it could be to avoid standing out)</p><p>meanwhile, fandom was also compiling all reminiscence appearances for characters, and the only one left for the 3rd years at the time was kanata. so there was THAT &quot;HOLY FUCK WE'RE DOOMED&quot; feeling too, knowing this means kanata is FOR SURE going to be the 5* of the ryuseitai reminiscence. so i remember trying to predict when ryuseitai reminiscence could happen PURELY through how long ago kanata's last 5* was LOL.</p><h2 id="event-story-thoughts">event story thoughts</h2><p>AND THEN FINALLY, I UNLOCKED THE STORY AND STARTED TO LIVETWEET IT and i tried to get a translation out asap BECAUSE HOOOLY SHIT HIS SCENES WERE CRAZY. HE WAS SO MEEK AND SCARED WHILE BEING MADE FUN OF BUT HE WAS STILL TRYING TO BE A HERO!? HE TRIED TO SAVE A TIED-UP EICHI?! THIS IS RELEVANT TO THE CROSSROAD PLOT BECAUSE HE INADVERTENTLY RUINED KEITO'S PLAN BY DOING THIS...!?!? KURO AND CHIAKI FRIENDSHIP!??!?!? <em>KURO AND CHIAKI WERE THE NERD BEFRIENDS DELINQUENT TROPE!?!?!?</em></p><p>this is the 3rd reminiscence in the same year, so fans were fueled even more that SURELY, SURELY RYUSEITAI IS SOON?! AFTER ALL THESE BUILDING BLOCKS WERE ADDED IN THE SAME YEAR...??</p><p>little did we know they had WAAAAY more in mind for us than just that (like, we didn't even know about how kanata was seen as a living god by his household yet, that was revealed a whole month later. WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT JIN HAVING RELATIONS TO RYUSEITAI JUST YET EITHER!!!!). little did we know that chiaki wearing glasses wasn't even a thing of <em>the past</em>. that he actually STILL wears them... and we only found out about THAT part months later in sweet halloween, another insane event for chiaki's lore!!</p><p>but gosh i remember so many fans, me included, feeling both shocked and pleasantly surprised by the story reveal, but also so sad for him because he just Did Not Seem Okay. there's the obvious one where he was mocked on stage, but his last chapter in crossroad gave really worrying signs of someone desperate to be a hero and struggling in an environment that's constantly against him. so a lot of crossroad fanworks were either meek glasses chiaki trying his best but clearly scared, or sometimes much more desolate like him being bullied.</p><p>meanwhile, him legitimately being A Megane Boy Who Was Bullied made chiaki's classic <a href="https://x.com/310mc1/status/1728536868759740711" target="_blank">&quot;SHUT UP, FOUR EYES&quot; at akiomi in the main story</a> even more !? because wait a second... YOU were a megane too, though?! (little did we know, we were eventually going to learn that chiaki has a complex about his glasses self so it actually makes perfect sense... ☺)</p><p>the theories and meta were FLOOOODINGGGG my twitter TL throughout the event period. sadly i don't remember much of it anymore, and i can't find them either, but i'm sure people were linking 2nd year chiaki back to all the hints we got so far (like how chiaki said he got sick of the color red at one point), as well as talking about how far he's come based on climax, supernova, etc.</p><p>random tangent but tsumugi's birthday happened in the middle of crossroad event, and his birthday somehow broke the servers and it took AGES for it to be fixed. i don't 100% remember anymore what the bugs were, but it was practically impossible to play his birthday campaign and i think the crossroad event too. fans could barely celebrate the poor guy's birthday. so that was also mixed in as a new historical event for the fandom too LMAO</p><p>AND NOT TO MENTION!!! RYUSEITAI 3RD CD WAS JUST AROUND THE CORNER TOO SO IT WAS AN I N S A N E WEEK FOR A RYUSEITAIP!!</p><p>just... SOOOO many fanworks of connecting 2nd year chiaki to his present (3rd year) self, happy with ryuseitai!! getting what he wanted! so much focus on how his &quot;it'll be okay!&quot; sounded so weak and fearful... so much on how he tried to be a hero no matter how scared he was... the resurgence of theories about eichi and chiaki's possible relationship (i talk about that <a href="/20240208_1" target="_blank">here</a>)... some people just straight up feeling so horribly sad about his crossroad scenes in crossroad that they instead drew nerd chiaki being cute and happy LMAOO</p><p>keep in mind crossroad WAS ON THE SAME YEAR AS CLIMAX.
