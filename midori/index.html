incoming because i have LOTS OF THOUGHTS about “midori being unaware of how chiaki specifically feels about him” and now i wanna think about it while keeping the “i kept everyone’s morisawa-senpai to myself” line from climax in mind</p><div toc><div class="gallery"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGus2rQWwAEHCXG?format=jpg&name=large" class="meta-images"><div class="desc">Comet Show, CHAPTER</div></div><div class="gallery"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGus2rXWcAAg6aQ?format=jpg&name=large" class="meta-images"><div class="desc">Climax, He Won't Cry 2</div></div></div><p>the climax lines makes me wonder…. could another reason why midori was determined to be reliable was to also “free” chiaki from having all his time taken up by midori’s hopelessness…? it’d make sense considering what he says in the epilogues… but like, i wanna dig even Further</p><p>basically the nuance i’m thinking of right now is more to do with “another proof that midori lacks a self-centered mindset about chiaki is that he pushed himself to be as reliable as possible IMMEDIATELY so that chiaki doesn’t always use up his time for midori” essentially, midori avoiding “keeping” that “everyone’s hero” person all for himself even after chiaki graduates</p><p>this might be a crazy theory but. it would add up to how COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY unaware he is that chiaki loves him for Very specific (selfish) reasons as in i think midori thinks that a lot of chiaki’s attention on him was yes, love, but also because he was so pathetic note that in climax he says “why did he get so involved with me?” and he has a similar thought in !! main story. “you’re seeing me off /for some reason/“…</p><p>he doesn’t truly Know why chiaki is always so attentive towards him, and i think he tries to figure out<br>his own answer eventually… “because i needed pushing the most, probably”. which frustrates him to<br>think because by god he’s trying so hard to grow and not be so hopeless<br>this would Further explain how exhausted he gets by comet show when he feels that his only convos<br>with chiaki is about how he still needs pampering, starting from their first interaction in the story, all the<br>way to when they’re alone</p><p>honestly this is basically The Same Meta about !! era midori as always, but seen from the angle of<br>“midori aggressively trying to make chiaki understand he is NOT worth more time than the other<br>members” i.e. he very much strives for equality/a “sharing” of chiaki among ryuseitai<br>because chiaki is important to Everyone in ryuseitai not just midori. and that’s what midori fought to<br>make chiaki understand in comet show<br>he barely focused on his own circumstances and instead talked about how tetora still needs chiaki,<br>shinobu and tetora deserve praise etc<br>but by doing so i think midori has made chiaki more and more hyper aware(??) of his intense feelings<br>specifically for midori…<br>because midori tried to tell him to treat each of them properly and give real praise, he made it so chiaki<br>Doesn’t /just/ pamper midori anymore<br>instead, chiaki now channels his love differently. in a way more “appropriate” and specific towards<br>midori. and eventually, respectful too<br>which… like? explains so much about the two post-comet show? i’d almost argue this would explain<br>why midori responds like this to chiaki</p><p>in the sense that the surface level is “why the hell are You seeing yourself as who raised me, we aren’t<br>related, you’re not my family so you can’t have fostered me”<br>and the deeper layer is<br>“midori’s completely unaware why chiaki says all this, and Thinks it’s because of that”<br>he /thinks/ chiaki keeps attempting to put himself in a caretaker role because he sees them as “those who<br>need care” (esp sees midori as one)<br>but in reality, that’s mostly what chiaki’s actions ended up doing. his intention is NOT that. even in<br>comet show, he tried to argue—<br>when midori pointed this out, to let him know he’s misunderstanding. he hesitated though, i assume<br>because it’s just Too Close To His Trauma and he was Not ready to talk about his past at the time<br>and i think midori really Was misunderstanding, which makes sense because—<br>a big part of comet show chiaki is that his intentions DID NOT translate well into his actions, leading to<br>every undesired result possible. it was what made him feel responsible and the blame of everything<br>all along, chiaki had absolutely intended to take them seriously<br>his actions were flawed, not his feelings<br>and midori helped him with the first few steps of where he went wrong in conveying his true feelings<br>inside. namely<br>1: the praise was too generic<br>2: it didn’t feel genuine because it felt like what you’d say to a baby to shut them up<br>lmao this is going all over the place. basically i think midori might have indirectly been the cause of<br>chiaki’s recent statements towards midori. midori wanted to push chiaki to finally give proper attention<br>to tetora and shinobu (and therefore ryuseitai as a whole too)<br>likely because his perception of chiaki’s care for him is “you do it because you think i’m a pathetic<br>weakling who needs help the most when in reality THEY’RE the ones who need you right now”<br>plus, midori has a tendency to project his own issues on ryuseitai, saying it’s “us”<br>and i think he was doing it a little in comet show. a handful of the things he mentioned mostly applied<br>to him rather than all three juniors<br>all in all… i just wonder if midori was subconsciously (or consciously?) trying to move chiaki away<br>from him with pretty solid advice<br>even though he’s unaware of some things about chiaki and projected a bit too much on tetora and<br>shinobu, he succeeded in getting chiaki to give proper praise to all three juniors!!<br>like his thought process is “i gotta get senpai to understand that we are Not weaklings,<br>stop putting only time in me, and treat shinobu-kun and tetora-kun how they deserve it”<br>while BEING COMPLETELY UNAWARE that chiaki really DOES have special, specific feelings for<br>Him.<br>and chiaki has just been conveying it “badly”, just like how he was conveying his love and care to all of<br>them awkwardly (up until supervillain)<br>stella maris is the biggest hint droppers… i wouldn’t have realized without the scenes of chiaki finding a<br>way to convey his love<br>but failing even when he “was really trying to be considerate”<br>… except he absolutely does get better at conveying his undying care for midori!! by the live show, he<br>figures out a way to comfort midori in a MIDORI way. in a way that would only work on MIDORI!!!<br>all so he can make midori happy!!! he wants to listen to midori’s words and figure out how to do it<br>right…<br>all the while midori is unaware that chiaki’s taking his words to heart, and applying it to convey his<br>VERY SPECIFIC AND ABSOLUTELY JUST FOR MIDORI feelings towards midori<br>tl;dr<br>midori: i gotta get him to stop ~supporting~ me and focus more on Them<br>chiaki: wow wait i think i’m starting to understand how to convey the exact ways i love him (thank you<br>takamine i will definitely show you how big my love is for you i love you I LOVE YOU!!!!)<br>crazy…<br>this is seriously a long one but i had to get these thoughts out. i need to put it in a blog post somewhere<br>though because if i’m onto something for future stories i will Scream. like i can’t be imagining this<br>right? midori seems too unaware of chiaki’s true intentions/feelings!!</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Analysis/"
