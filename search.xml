    <content><![CDATA[
I'm grateful because of you I can easily access to their story and understand midochia better, what makes you ship midochia to the point that you have great passion for them?

Sent and answered in November 2023. tweet link of the answer

i’m really happy to know it helps! that question oh man (breathes) warning in advance that a long answer for that will be SUPER LONG… I’M SO SORRY…
short answer: to love chiaki is to love midori, and to love midori is to love chiaki. being a midoriP inevitably means i love chiaki, and likewise, being a chiakiP inevitably means i love midori. every new piece of canon for the two of them supports this cycle so well that it’s impossible for me not to be this passionate about them!!
long answer:
for context, i got into enstars back in 2016, so i’ve experienced in real-time the release of ryuseitai stories starting from holiday party (end of 2016) until today. this is a pretty big factor of my increasing passion for midochia (+ chiaki and midori as individuals as well).
it’s a little tricky to pin down exactly what makes me go THIS batshit insane about midochia, as honestly, there’s so much about midochia that lights a fire in my heart. but i’d say the biggest absolute no.1 reason is my love for chiaki. i absolutely love chiaki. and midochia? midochia is entirely centered around chiaki.
midori and chiaki’s relationship came to be because of chiaki. it’s all because of chiaki’s persistence, his dedication, his love, determination, his selfless care to see midori shine and become the hero that chiaki saw in him from the very moment they first met.
this center point is echoed throughout all their stories over and over, to the point that midori can’t escape being reminded of chiaki (midori seeing red = reminded of chiaki), or someone will always relate chiaki back to midori. (other characters going &quot;oh are you feeling lonely without [chiaki]?&quot;)
even when chiaki isn’t necessarily part of a midori-involved story, it relates back to chiaki. see: orihime and hikoboshi (2018 story) and how it explores the tension between subaru and midori. their relationship is based around how they only know and talk to each other because of chiaki (basketball club)… how subaru is/was envious of midori because chiaki became interested in midori and poured all his efforts into him.
midori’s storyline quickly reaches a point where it is Impossible To Separate Chiaki From Him. to understand midori and his development, it’s necessary to understand all the little and big things chiaki has been planting and doing for him, that’s influencing him and everything around him
by climax (2017 repayment festival story, graduation season for chiaki and kanata), it’s so undeniable how much effort, time and love chiaki has put into midori, that one of tetora’s reasons for getting angry at midori is &quot;what was the WHOLE point of everything [chiaki] did for you this ENTIRE year if this is how you’re gonna be at the final moment?&quot;
by the end of midori’s 1st year, all of this leads him to proclaim something very important to chiaki:

“When we first met, you asked me, “Won't you become a hero?”
And I never gave you an answer… But now I'll answer you not with words, but with actions.
Even if I did say it with words, you wouldn’t listen anyway…… So please watch my transformation closely.”

the conclusion to midori's arc in ! era stories is &quot;without chiaki, midori wouldn’t be here.&quot; without chiaki completely and unconditionally accepting midori for who he is, the midori we know and love wouldn’t have had a single chance to shine and be happy in the way he deserves to be.
this alone is an absolutely beautiful part about midochia, but so far all i’ve established is how much their relationship has benefited midori.
back to how i was saying that i love chiaki. i absolutely love everything about chiaki. i think chiaki only deserves the best. he should never have to suffer, he should only ever be happy
after meteor impact came out in 2019, those feelings amplified by a MILLION. i came out of that story so heartbroken to learn that chiaki broke down severely from such an unreasonable situation. i love why it happened (the fact it’s related to disappointing his only junior, subaru, just makes too much sense), i love that it finally explains so much about why chiaki is so stubborn to keep up a strong front in his 3rd year (of course he would after feeling like a failure to his junior), but it hurt so fucking bad like he genuinely did nothing wrong, he was just a bullied kid who really loves heroes and wanted to be one, but no matter how much he cried for help no hero came for him :&quot;) and his main conclusion to what happened is &quot;i never want to disappoint [the people cheering for me] (like subaru) ever again&quot;.
it’s heartbreaking TO SAY THE LEAST. just feels fucking awful as a chiakiP to see him lock that breakdown deep inside (his cry for help!! his need for someone to just tell him that he’s doing okay!! he’s worked hard!!!) and instead focus all his energy on becoming a hero (which does make sense! of course chiaki would want to focus on his dream! he finally gets the chance to make it a reality!). and in his 3rd year, it QUICKLY reaches to the point of overworking himself (so many stories in ! era talk about how he overworks until collapse or even almost getting hit by a car from exhaustion…!?! and that was mentioned in stories set VERY early in his 3rd year).
meteor impact sort of ends on a happy note, but i just couldn’t buy it. to me, all i really ended up reading was a story about how chiaki was robbed from his happy ending. that he was forced to turn his tragedy into his last chance to become the hero he always yearned to be.
i could’ve completely lost all hope that chiaki could get a happy ending for himself eventually… but thankfully did Not lose any hope, because of midori.
thank GOD meteor impact was in 2019, after every single beautiful ! era ryuseitai story, because we have already been provided story after story about how ryuseitai supports and helps chiaki. but most especially, how MIDORI is the missing piece to giving chiaki a chance to heal from his trauma.
from ! era stories alone, we learn that:

in sweet halloween (2017 story), midori was the one who got worried over chiaki acting &quot;strange&quot; (not like his usual self). he’s the reason it was found out early that chiaki is terrified of ghosts and can’t handle halloween. his insistence to figure out what’s wrong with chiaki is how chiaki was able to get a support system and make it through a season he’s so terrified of (in other words, feels vulnerable and un-heroic in)


“Anyway, there really isn’t anything to be embarrassed about… We all have things we can’t stand… In a way, it’s more embarrassing and uncool to keep insisting that you like something you actually hate…
It’s natural to have dislikes… Just be true to yourself… Aren’t you the one who’s always telling me stuff like, ‘I love you no matter what’…?”


in zodiac (2017 story), midori mistook daikichi for chiaki and in the process, immediately tries to get him away from harm, and even expresses something very important, which is:


“You’re always, always worrying and fussing over other people all the time… That’s why I think it’d be terrible if something bad happened to you… Um, like… I can’t put it in words well, but… It just wouldn’t be fair…”


midori saw (doggie) chiaki, a vulnerable small animal who could’ve easily gotten harmed, and said “it wouldn’t be fair if something bad happened to you” (VERY important considering meteor impact)


and in climax (2017 story)… midori was the one who accidentally encountered chiaki at a vulnerable moment, crying his heart out about graduation, but then immediately putting up a strong front and smiling as soon as he notices midori around. which angered (and confused) midori:


(Ahh… I wonder why I feel this way…? He hasn’t done anything wrong… But seeing him smile irritates me to no end for some reason…
Morisawa-senpai, why’re you smiling…? You, who loves everyone and is loved by everyone in return… How can you even be smiling right now…?
Graduation is supposed to be something upsetting, so agonizingly lonely and sad… Yet, are you really gonna try and look cool while parting ways, until the very end…?
No… Even before all this, you’ve always been—…)

time and time again, midori questions: “why do you refuse to show that weak side?” “why do you have to go through these things?” “why are you putting up a strong front, when it’s only hurting you further?”
and remembering all of these scenes after reading that heart-wrenching backstory for chiaki in meteor impact… filled me with so much hope.
i love chiaki, i love him so much and i want him to always be happy. and he CAN be happy. even after so many awful things happening to him in his past (wrongly threatened by kuro*, feeling like a failure after disappointing his beloved junior subaru, constantly bullied by ex-ryuseitai members for ALMOST TWO YEARS, breaking down after admitting nobody ever came to save him no matter how much he cried for help), it’s not too late to save him and give him the happy ending he deserves.
* kuro has apologized many times for this and felt extremely guilty, and i'm not upset that kuro did this in the first place, but it's still true that chiaki went through a lot of things and this was one of them.
and i can believe in that possibility because of midori. after acknowledging every little bit of thing chiaki did for him in his 1st year, midori decided to commit and do something so preciously important for chiaki, who once broke down when none of his efforts came to fruition: “At the very least, I’ll prove to you that your year didn’t go to waste.”
and THIS is the very point about midochia that made me go from “they’re so cute and precious together 🥺” to batshit insane passion and love for them.
up until meteor impact (so until 2019), i was actually a chiaki multishipper more than anything. midochia was one of my top favorite ships, but i still loved thinking about chiaki with other people. i even considered him a guy who had “5+ different boyfriend candidates” back then.
but meteor impact changed All of that for me. after reading that story, i got so obsessed with the idea of chiaki specifically getting his happy ending that i couldn’t stop thinking “i need it to be midori. i need chiaki to be with midori i NEED midori to save him. it has to be midori”
and i’m not going to lie, i know i sound crazy right now but… that obsession is how i got more and more into the two. i already loved chiaki, midori, and midochia. but by loving and investing more time in midori’s lore, i was loving chiaki all the more than i already did. by having invested so much time into chiaki’s lore, i was falling in love even MORE with midori, with his beautiful kind heart, his persistence and stubbornness to do WHATEVER it takes to repay chiaki (and repay ryuseitai too!). everything about them and their relationship became all the more beautiful to me.
2019 was a slow year for enstars. there wasn’t much content as enstars was starting to prepare for enmusic and !! era release, so i spent the majority of 2019 just thinking up delusions after delusions of how midori would help chiaki tear off that “strong front” mask. about how beautiful it’d be if chiaki could get healing from midori in the ways he deserves. or how chiaki deserves to know and see that he absolutely DOES deserve every good, wonderful thing happen to him.
and then… !! era started in 2020 and holy fucking shit
literally the very first few scenes for midori and chiaki were:


them alone together (main story. THEIR MAIN STORY CGS ARE EVEN TOWARDS EACH OTHER) AND focused on how midori is trying to be reliable and ease chiaki’s burden during a busy time for him


midori attempting to stop chiaki from self-sabotage and kick him back on stage because “you're part of ryuseitai too” (motor show)


reminders once again that anything midori says will relate back to chiaki (motor show, when he out of nowhere vents about how chiaki’s i love you's “weren't true after all”)


this was all released by april 2020 (and !! era started in march 2020), so i was like &quot;FUCK. MY DELUSIONS WEREN’T DELUSIONS??? WTF&quot;. so yeah this is basically when it was sealed that i’m never gonna stop being insane about midochia for the rest of my life, actually.
after my heart shattered by meteor impact in 2019, midori starting off !! era with a &quot;guys did you know morisawa-senpai deserves only the best because he always works so hard&quot; just elevated me to a whole new dimension. like damn, ! era stories were already one thing with how impossible it is to avoid chiaki being mentioned in a midori story, somehow !! era stories took that to a whole new level because now even MIDORI deliberately refuses to shut the fuck up about chiaki. and good!!!!! fucking GOOD!!!!! how can i not be elated by this as a chiakiP. my absolute favorite character (midori) constantly wants only the best for my other absolute favorite character (chiaki)? and it makes perfect sense why, because chiaki had already literally dedicated a WHOLE YEAR OF HIS LIFE just to make midori shine!?!? yeah. yeah, there was no going back. midochia is perfection
and the rest is history… i can definitely continue this because it’s midochia (didn’t even talk about comet show My Beloved. or supervillain, also my beloved. ryuseitai stories my beloved my world) and i can’t shut the fuck up about midochia To Be Honest, but i need to find a stopping point somewhere aahhh 😭
i will say though that the 2023 content for chiaki, midori and ryuseitai only further amplified the desire to see chiaki happy and healed, because ryuseitai’s tense arc throughout !! era finally reached its happy conclusion!!! and one of those reasons is because supervillain (2023 story) finally brought chiaki’s vulnerabilities/backstory to light!! it’s an incredible first step that chiaki admitted to tetora that he was a bullied nerdy kid, but his trauma from his breakdown will take a while to be uncovered and then be healed from, because nobody knows he went through that…
and based on everything we’ve seen so far in ! era and !! era for both midori and chiaki’s storylines, midori will likely be involved with the next 5* chiaki event (that is written by akira). just like how he was in climax (chiaki 5* and midori 5*), sweet halloween (chiaki 5* midori 4*), and comet show (chiaki 5*, midori 4* and kanata 4*). note that all these stories had a 5* chiaki, covered huge parts of his vulnerability/“non-hero” side and midori played a huge role in them (of course, climax is midori-centric too anyway)
because when it comes down to it, midochia is entirely centered around chiaki. it’s all about how chiaki’s effort, kindness, love, and care all deserve to be repayed with just as much kindness, love, effort, and care and EVEN MORE. and midori has acknowledged all of this in climax already:

“All the kindness you’ve given me — Even if I spent my whole life trying, I don’t think I could ever fully return the favor. But at the very least, I’ll prove to you that your year didn’t go to waste.
Thanks to you, even I’ve changed a little… and I’ll show that to you now.”



“Hey, come on now… This isn’t the time to be crying, please finish what you have to do. We’d like to hear your usual catchphrase.
Please shine in your own way, as you always have — within the center of everyone.
I never really disliked seeing that… Morisawa-senpai.”

and since !! era started (i.e. after chiaki and kanata graduated), he has been on a mission to repay every ounce of every little thing chiaki has done for him. just as chiaki provided midori with the happiness midori “never once thought he’d ever get to experience”, chiaki WILL get the happy ending he always deserved to have since day 1.
and that’s why… i’m this passionate about them… it all comes back to the short answer i gave earlier: to love chiaki is to love midori, and to love midori is to love chiaki!!
for a tl;dr: i made a thread that similarly talks about why i love midochia this much, so it kinda acts as a tl;dr of what i said here.
i know this was…long…… so thank you if you read this far!! 😭 ❤️ i hope this helps see the charm in midochia charm even more, especially while reading the stories! hehe

climax, sweet halloween, zodiac, orihime and hikoboshi, meteor impact, !! main story, motor show, comet show (kinda), supervillain (kinda)

    <title>Answered Question: Fandom’s Theories About Eichi And Chiaki’s Relationship Until Its Reveal</title>
    <url>//20240208_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Wait I didn’t consider that you were there before the reveal of Chiaki and Eichi’s connection 👀 Do you think you can give your experience on what it was like when people were trying to figure out what kind of connection those two had and what it was like when it was finally revealed they’re childhood friends from the hospital? Sorry I know you get a bunch of questions on what it was like in the old days of the fandom. But speaking as a newbie to Enstars I find it so fun and interesting to get info on what it was like in the early years of the fandom from those who were there and are still invested!

Sent and answered in February 2024. tweet link of the answer

i don’t mind answering those kinds of questions, there’s a lot of fun enstars history both in the fandom and in the canon and it’s fun to preserve it in a way (?)
i entered the fandom late 2016 so sadly i wasn’t there for the ex-fine chiaki theory, since i assume people were like &quot;oh Never Mind lmao&quot; when element came out and revealed it was tsumugi/nagisa/hiyori who were part of the unit, etc. but i do remember the fanart!!! if you go back to 2015-2016 fanworks for chiaki and eichi, you’ll easily find fanart of that concept, all because of eichi calling chiaki by his first name in the main story (which people felt it HAD to be significant)
after it got debunked, i assume people moved on to a new theory thanks to wanted and supernova existing at around the same time as element… ? i’m not 100% sure since all those stories were in 2016, but it’d make sense. i’m looking through old tweets to get back a bit of my memory. but i think climax DEFINITELY started the thoughts back up because WHY WOULDN’T IT LMAO with how eichi was supporting chiaki’s dream… so people were all !!!! maybe they’re hospital friends after all…?!
at around this time, people were reliving the main story moments between the two and eating it up over and over and letting it feed their insane thoughts, thanks to the novel, manga, and then the full voiced main story that got released in 2017.
then according to my tweets, it seems like checkmate (may 2017) made the people with the hospital friends theory go &quot;…oh🧍‍♂️ never mind ig&quot; because it revealed that eichi and leo were hospital acquaintances/friends. can’t confirm this though and it’s been too long to remember clearly
BUT THEN… crossroad in july!! that made people go 🔥🔥🔥🔥 finding out CHIAKI SAVES EICHI AND THEN WANTS TO VISIT HIM… i remember a lot of tweets being like &quot;please show us this scene i’m begging PLEASEE TELL US MOOOREEE&quot; (little did we know).
so between 2017 up until the reveal in 2019 with saga, it was just a &quot;well, who fucking knows, but it HAS to be significant somehow because of all these stories. maybe. who knows!&quot;. particularly crossroad, while tasty, made it harder to tell if they would’ve known each other as hospital friends, since it sounded like chiaki didn’t really know eichi well. i recall that at the time, it was kinda hard to imagine them as hospital friends because &quot;then why don’t they remember each other&quot; (but i remember people ignoring that part just as much for their hospital friends delusions. good for them /pos)
the theories started to &quot;die out&quot; a bit by the end of 2018 because all the hints were in 2016-2017 and the only 🔥🔥🔥 moment between eichi and chiaki was in the 2018 april fools story (which was Amazing), so… people were caught off guard SO FUCKING BADDDD, me included, when saga finally revealed the truth. OUT OF NOWHERE. NONE OF US WERE EXPECTING SAGA OF ALL STORIES TO HAVE SUCH IMPORTANT LORE FOR CHIAKI (AND EICHI) 😭😭😭
like a lot of stories, saga came out in 2 parts. the first part was chill and pretty fun. as a chiakiP he was just being cute in the chapters so far. but then on january 5th… the 2nd half came out and Oh My God. THE SHOCKKK. EVERYONE ALL AT ONCE &quot;WAIT THEY WERE HOSPITAL FRIENDS AFTER ALl??? WE WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG!?@?!@?!?@!?#?!$?!?!?$!??&quot;
some of my tweets from that time
&quot;EICHI AND CHIAKI MET EACH OTHER WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER??? but it wasnt that much they just met and talked a few times in a hospital room im wtf I CANT BELIEVE ITS CANON&quot;
&quot;wtf what is this KGSKGE IS THIS AN ANIME OF LONG LOST CHILDHOOD FRIENDS yeah we both forgot about it but when we talked to each other more in school it all slowly came back to us uwu AKIRA GOING FULL OUT MAN&quot;
&quot;the entire godamn fandom: GUYS EICHI CALLS CHIAKI &quot;CHIAKI&quot; WHEN HE DOESN’T DO THAT WITH MANY PEOPLE EXCEPT HIS UNITMATES AND KEITO GUYS!!! GUYS THERES SMTHN IN THERE
akira: anyways tsumugi was in fine, leo and eichi were hospital friends in school
us: ……
akira:
us:
akira: and then eichi and chiaki were long lost childhood friends who forgot all about their meeting until they met each other again in school and slowly the memories poured into them as they talked m&quot;
in retrospect, i think the ultimate funniest part of it all to me is……… both theories were right in their own way.
&quot;ex-fine chiaki&quot; isn’t true but &quot;chiaki supported ex-fine at one point (until he found out the truth behind their actions)&quot; IS REAL LMAOOO SAGA WAS THE FIRST TO CONFIRM IT, AND METEOR IMPACT MENTIONS IT AGAIN!!! I LAUGHED OUT SO HARD LIKE PEOPLE WEREN’T EVEN TECHNICALLY WRONG ABOUT THE EX-FINE!CHIAKI IDEAS. and then &quot;hospital friends&quot; ended up being true AND WHAT WE DIDN’T ACCOUNT FOR IS THAT THEY MIGHT’VE JUST FORGOTTEN EACH OTHER AT ONE POINT !!! JUST BECAUSE THEY SEEMED LIKE STRANGERS IN CROSSROAD DIDN’T MEAN THEY DIDN’T KNOW EACH OTHER!!! it’s sooo fucking funny honestly.
BUT IT WAS SUCH A GREAT DAY TO CELEBRATE, THE EICHI/CHIAKI FANART WAS EVERYWHERE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THE WHOLE FANDOM CHEERED!!!! that was a magical time because BOTH eichiP and chiakiP were so happy by the discovery… (which is what makes me love their friendship even more, you can tell both oshiPs just fucking LOVE this dynamic soooo much!!!) like it was just… unbelievable???? the theory existed for almost 4 years. FOUR YEARSSSS TO CONFIRM WE WEREN’T WRONG TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE &quot;CHIAKI&quot; NAME LMAOOOOOOOOO AKIRA IS INSANE?? there was new crossroad eichi/chiaki fanart, hospital babies fanart, magical fanart of how they slowly came to realize it’s the same person they met long ago… 🥺🥺🥺
oh and because it was such a random reveal, there were a LOOOT of &quot;so everyone just knows each other in their childhood huh&quot; memes because. of course there’d be. to this day this is an on-going thing in enstars stories kGMSKGS akira: everyone is childhood friends with each other, actually . alongside with &quot;and eichi STILL says chiaki isn’t his friend after all of this huh. ok dude if you say so&quot; tweets. so true. sooo true. and one more i remember is people joking that &quot;oh my god maybe akira saw all our theories and decided fuck it i’ll make it a reality actually&quot;
but yeah overall it really was mainly because of the &quot;chiaki&quot;, also the villain vs hero stuff from main story and april fools… and all the stories they had that kept making people eager to Know… since well, it’s eichi we’re talking about here. it was so intriguing to read into why he’d keep showing bias towards chiaki and ryuseitai time and time again, despite initially mentioning how exhausting and loathesome heroes are. and likewise, chiaki having a pretty good relationship with the guy most of the cast deems a villain was so &quot;Tell Us More&quot; energy
so it was VERY VERY VEEERY satisfying to find out that we were NEVER wrong to see something in that, even if the reveal took such a long time to happen!! the most satisfying part of it all was that, just because theories were debunked, didn’t mean their relationship was insignificant… 🥺 and now we’ve come this far with them… they’ve become so so significant that we’re even likely to get an eichi look back gacha uuuu 🥺🥺🥺🥺
this tweet i made after ep:link came out in september 2019 is making me laugh bad though, so i’d like to share it (context: ep:link had a small part where eichi mentions he invited chiaki to join starpro LOL)
&quot; fellas, is it weird to call the person you knew in your childhood and then met again in high school after he saved you in a livehouse and visited you in the hospital, who you then helped keep his unit alive, and then eventually helped with his career too, a ’friend’ &quot;
i feel like the reveal that stella maris chiaki CG was towards eichi all along had that similar level of &quot;?!!?@?!?@?!@?!?&quot; as saga, like &quot;OHHHH MY GOD THEY REALLY ARE THAT RELEVANT!!!!&quot;, so that was nice to experience again for veterans, and i hope new chiaki and eichi fans also had fun experiencing it GKMGSKGE because yeah i’d say that that was pretty similar to how it felt back then too… just like, oh my god akira is not fucking around with this friendship!!! LET’S GOOOOO
i wrote this in a daze so i can only hope it makes some sense… thank you for asking!!! enstars history (as a game) is fun… i love how you can constantly be part of the journey to discover new, big things, it’s just sooo exciting

💚&quot;What're you on about all of a sudden…? Also, could you please not casually come to my classroom to hang out…?&quot;
💚&quot;I had to wear gakuran in middle school, so I do have it at home, but… I grew tall really fast, so I bet it'd be way too tight on me to wear now…&quot;
❤️&quot;Is that so! That's truly wonderful, Takamine! Keep on growing just like that! Become a man large enough to reach the sun…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Umm, Morisawa-senpai… I don't get what's up with you, but I'm busy right now, so could you save it for later…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? What are you busy with!? If there's anything I can help with, just let me know!
Aren't we comrades in Ryuseitai, Takamine!? All for one, and one for all!&quot;
❤️&quot;Aren't we comrades in Ryuseitai, Takamine!? All for one, and one for all! That's what Ryuseitai is all about! Fuhahaha!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;He's seriously suffocating…&quot;
💚&quot;I'm sorry, Anzu-san… If that guy's bothering you, I'll tie him, tape his mouth shut, and lock him in that storage over there, okay…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Whaa!? Like storing away a heater used only in winter!? But sure! Being tied up and confined is what an ally of justice'd go through…♪&quot;
💚&quot;I'm always excited to see Anzu-san's next design, so it's been motivating me to work hard in my idol activities lately…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;A-ha, that's amazing, Anzu! You're getting good at handling Takamine! I really struggled to manage it, y'know!&quot;
💚&quot;My bed is full of Anzu-san's handmade plushies…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Really!? My bed is full of tokusatsu goods! We're so similar, Takamine! We Ryuseitai are brethren of the same soul! Fuhahaha…!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Uuu, please stop pestering me already… Just what did you come here for? You mentioned something about gakuran…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine! Please listen to me! Show a little more interest in me instead of the mascot character, please…!&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, that's right, you were doing stunt work… Not that I really care, but is that why you're injured so often, Morisawa-senpai…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep! Would you like to give it a try? It's really fun! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;No way, it sounds dangerous…&quot;
❤️&quot;That's why I've come here for you! You're fine with it, aren't you, Takamine!? Let's band together as one and conquer this hardship side-by-side…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhh, you're just doing whatever you like… It sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so could I pass…?&quot;
💚&quot;It sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so could I pass…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhaha, then I'll throw that pass back at you! If you don't shoot, you won't score! If you don't score, you won't win! Whether it's in basketball or in life! So, Takamine, it's time! Show me your slam dunk…☆&quot;
❤️&quot;If you don't shoot, you won't score! If you don't score, you won't win! Whether it's in basketball or in life! So, Takamine, it's time! Show me your slam dunk…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Could you please stop saying whatever comes to your mind…? I don't even get what that means… I wanna die…&quot;
❤️&quot;We should live our lives with full vigor too, Takamine! Starting with making this mission a success! Let's rush with our heads held high…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Woah—Please don't drag me over with you… I'm used to it by now, so I'm fine with it, but it'll be a bother to Anzu-san, y'know…?&quot;
🖤&quot;Ah, Midori-kun! And Anzu-Anego, too! 'Suuup, I hope you're doing well! Thanks for coming all the way here — You're here to help guide Taishou, right!?&quot;
💚&quot;No, Morisawa-senpai just forcibly dragged me here…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine and I rushed to his home to borrow his gakurans from middle school. He kept growing bigger, so he often had to buy a new one. So we found uniforms fitting of our sizes~♪&quot;
✨&quot;Huh… Takamin's got it so rough; he always has to deal with all of Chi~chan-senpai's ideas~&quot;
💚&quot;Eek— I'm so sorry… Er, erm, umm…?&quot;
✨&quot;Ahaha. Takamin's way too freaked out~&quot;
🎸&quot;Takamine was like this the first few times he met Buchou, too~ He'd always say Buchou's terrifying 'cause of how loud he was~ Man, it takes me back. ♪&quot;
💚&quot;Eep—… No, um… Nobody mentioned anything about wanting to appear, so, err…?&quot;
🐉&quot;Haha. This guy's similar to how Morisawa was in the past.&quot;
❤️&quot;I-Is that so? No— Erm, yeah, it's exactly as Takamine said! It's like we're practicing for a school festival play! Fuhahahaha…!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Um, hold on… What was that about me being similar to how Morisawa-senpai used to be in the past…? I'd like to sue for defamation based on what that means…&quot;
🐉&quot;Ahh… My bad, I misspoke. Forget what I said. I'm sure Morisawa'd much rather look cool in front of his juniors.&quot;
❤️&quot; 'Go go, let's go~! Go go, let's go~! I'm cheering for you! Let's work hard together…☆' &quot;
💚&quot;Ooh… Morisawa-senpai's pretty good at this…?&quot;
❤️&quot; 'Mm—!? Who's there!? Blasted villain — How dare you disturb the peace of our school! I'll be the one to take you down! Woosh— Transform! Cheerleader Red…☆' &quot;
💚&quot;He transformed!? Huh!? What kinda school drama is this…?&quot;
❤️&quot;You're up next, Takamine! It's time you try it out…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Eh? Uuu…? B-But I'm not mentally prepared…&quot;
🐉&quot;You can do this. You're a man, aren'tcha? Show us what you've got.&quot;
💚&quot;Uuu, ermm… Then I guess I'll do my best somehow…?&quot;
💚&quot;Uu, ermm… Then I guess I'll do my best somehow…? 'O-Ossu. I-I'm Morisawa… Wait, I mean, Takamine Midori… Can I go home now…?' &quot;
❤️&quot;You don't sound enthusiastic, cheerleader!? Come on, cheerleader! You've got this…☆&quot;
🐉&quot;Why're you cheerin' on the cheerleader, Morisawa?&quot;
❤️&quot;Whenever there's a photoshoot, I often get scolded and told, 'Quit doing transformation poses! Your arms and legs are so loud!' — But it's completely unintentional! Believe me!&quot;
💚&quot;So Morisawa-senpai's mouth isn't the only thing that's loud, even his arms and legs are…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine ran out of gas earlier, so feel free to take a break next to him over there, while the two of you watch over our figures…☆&quot;
💚&quot;I don't ever challenge myself to try new things, so… I think I kinda appreciate being dragged around and forced to do all sorts of things…? Don't tell Morisawa-senpai, though… He'll get way too ahead of himself…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Nagumo! Takamine! If you have enough energy to talk, then stand back up! It's time for our rehearsal! Aren't you both boys!? You should yell as hard as you can to the sun! It's a brand new daaaaaaaaaay!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Maybe he's trying to get Kiryu-senpai used to giving his all no matter the setting…?
Morisawa-senpai does use his head a little, doesn't he… I remember him doing something similar to me when I first joined Ryuseitai…&quot;
🖤&quot;Midori-kun, you come along too! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, yeah… Don't drag me along with you — you're really starting to resemble Morisawa-senpai, aren't you, Tetora-kun…? Ah~h, man~ What am I doing so early in the morning~? I just had to join such a lousy unit, huh…?&quot;
❤️&quot;The two of you seem to be in a good mood, huh? Wonderful, just wonderful! Energy is what youngsters are supposed to have! ♪&quot;
💚&quot;You're so obnoxious… You're not young anymore, Senpai, and you're being really overbearing, so how about you cut your energy down by half…?&quot;
❤️&quot;What was that!? I'm still bursting with youth and energy! Tokusatsu's said to be for kids, but it still makes me shed tears! My heart's always like a newborn! You're so cheeky, Takamine! You little~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh… Please stop clinging to me all casually, you're so suffocating…&quot;
Christmas Live
(4, incomplete)
💚&quot;It's so damn cold… I'm so depressed, I wanna die… I seriously miss Morisawa-senpai for some reason… I wonder if that heater is walking around somewhere…?&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm so glad you noticed and saved Kanata from his predicament in time! You're a splendid ally of justice of your own, aren't you, Takamine~ Theeere, there, there~♪ (pat, pat, pat)&quot;
❤️&quot;You've really got no enthusiasm, Takamine! Show some energy! You'll feel warmer if you sing and dance as much as possible! Ignite your engine! Our Christmas has only just begun!&quot;
💚&quot;Christmas hasn't even started, though… You're always, always in a rush with everything…&quot;
🏹&quot;Um…Am I fatigued, or does that Christmas tree look like a person?&quot;
❤️&quot;That's because it is a person! Its our promising star of Ryuseitai, Takamine Midori! He's got a great physique and he's outfitted in green, so he's the perfect fit for a Christmas tree, don't you think? ♪&quot;

💚&quot;Ughh, what a pain… I don't wanna move at all…&quot;
❤️&quot;You've got this!&quot;
💚&quot;N-Noo, don't wannaaa… The more you cheer me on, the less I feel like doing anything…&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh, what a pain… I don't wanna move at all…&quot;
❤️&quot;C'mon, let's get going!&quot;
💚&quot;Ack, please don't drag me over with you! Ahh, gosh, you're always so pushy…&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh, what a pain… I don't wanna move at all…&quot;

🌻&quot;What's wrong, what's wrong! You don't have enough guts! Become hotter, like the sun…! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Don't talk like that… Being reminded of a certain someone makes me wanna die… makes me wanna kill…&quot;
💚&quot;Whenever I saw the red color of the strawberries, I just sunk further into depression, and I seriously felt like I could die from it…&quot;
💚&quot;I know how you feel… Meddling way too much is the same as mistreatment… But, honestly… You start to get pretty lonely when you don't have that sort of thing anymore, so… I think you should treasure it more, y'know?&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhhh… That guy's coming here…? This sucks…&quot;
💛&quot;You are happy about it too, I can tell! Your face is breaking into a smile~&quot;
💚&quot;'Chiaki-oniisan' told you that I like mascot characters…? What's that guy doing, blabbering on about people's interests…&quot;

💚&quot;This is more like sketches by a kid rather than a project plan… Ah, but the designs of the kaijuus and monsters are kind of cute…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Right, right!? I'm pretty proud of my work! But I would much rather you pay attention to the hero outfits than that, to be honest!&quot;

❤️(Good, Takamine. You're trying to come at me instead of giving up. That's what being a boy's all about, you're so cool…☆
I won't hold back either, then. Come try and stop me, Takamine…!)
💚&quot;Ahaha, that was cool? Didn't Morisawa-senpai look way cooler than me, though…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine, complimenting me? Do you have a fever by any chance!? Let's go to the infirmary, we need to have you checked up!&quot;
❤️&quot;Ohh, wonderful! Takamine with his arms raised in front of the hoop gives off an overwhelming pressure! It's just splendid! Just what you'd expect from the 'Takamine Barricade'…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Well, it's not really uncomfortable or anything… I don't dislike being near him, I think…♪ But don't tell him, okay? I don't want him to annoy me about it…&quot;

Scroll of the Elements

💚&quot;No, see… Lately, Morisawa-senpai's been getting along really well with my parents… It felt like things would only get worse if he got any deeper, so I've been telling him to stop coming over… I don't want him ruining my peace at home…&quot;
💚&quot;Wai—Please don't hug me… Your body is three times warmer than usual after a liveshow… It's overbearing…&quot;
Colorful Autumn
(2, incomplete)
💚&quot;Ughh… I feel like if Morisawa-senpai found out about this, he'd say 'There was no need to hold back, Takamine!' and barge right into my house… I bet my parents would be super happy about it too, and I wouldn't have any time to skip out on work…&quot;
🖤&quot;You're too close, you're acting like Taichou! It's embarrassing to be stared at while drawing~&quot;
💚&quot;Me… like Morisawa-senpai…? Ugh, this is a nightmare… Being the same as that touchy-feely being's depressing… Maybe if I plunge my head and drown myself, I'll die easily…?&quot;

💚&quot;Um, no, I can't be the first one if you're already here, Morisawa-senpai… I'm so glad you got here first, anyway… If it was me yet again, it'd have been beyond awkward…&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh… Trying to act natural while being filmed is a hard request…&quot;
❤️&quot;Hang in there! You can definitely do it, Takamine! Hang in there…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, no need to cheer, actually.&quot;
❤️&quot;O-Oh, really? You've grown so strong now, seeing how you're not backing away. I'm so proud…!&quot;
Climax
(107, complete)
💚&quot;Please don't pat my head… You're as insanely touchy-feely as that… You're both so similar, as if you're brothers…&quot;
✨&quot;As touchy-feely as that…? Ohh, do you mean Chi~chan-senpai? Aww come on, no need to say something so vomit-inducing as that! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;I didn't go that far!?&quot;
✨&quot;There's just no way I could get along with anyone and everyone the same way he does.&quot;
💚&quot;I know, right… I mean, he doesn't even mind connecting with people who don't really fit in, like you and me… He's basically kind to just about anyone, isn't he…&quot;
💚&quot;I doubt you have any interest in me… I know we're in the same club, but we haven't really ever talked to each other, have we…&quot;
✨&quot;Mm~… That's 'cause ever since you came to school, Chi~chan-senpai's only had his eyes on you, so~ Maaaybe I'm a little jealous or something…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Huh…? What does that mea—&quot;
❤️&quot;Akehoshi! Takamine! What's up, what're you guys up to!? Are you sitting around and having a nice chat!? Sounds fun! Make some space for me! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Gah!? Hey, watch it… Please don't jump on me out of nowhere… You almost broke my spine…&quot;
❤️&quot;Heh! ♪ It's still a little chilly, so you'll start to feel cold if you don't move around!
That's why your senior decided to be considerate and share his warmth with you through a hug! Squeeze, squeeze~☆&quot;
❤️&quot;What's that? You're in pain, Takamine!? Alright then, let me perform the lifesaving technique I learned from Kanata! I'll give you oxygen through mouth-to-mouth…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Gahhh!? Get your face away from me, you weirdo! I'll seriously call the police…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Ahh, I can't control myself! I feel like hugging and kissing every single person I see!&quot;
💚&quot;You better cut it out soon, or I'll tie you up with rope…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, that sounds like the perfect hero crisis! I'm intrigued! But I'd rather you refrain from doing that for now!&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhaha! You guys should also change into your uniforms and join us! Let's have a final showdown! Come on now, let me feel your growth firsthand…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Mm… Sounds tiring, so I'll pass… I'm annoyed enough that you dragged me here when I'm not even the type to go to parties…&quot;
❤️&quot;You should join us, Takamine. I'd be happy if you could at least cheer me on. This might be the last time you see me in a basketball uniform in all my glory, y'know? Make sure you burn it straight into your very eyes! Fuhahaha! ☆&quot;
❤️ &quot;This might be the last time you see me in a basketball uniform in all my glory, y'know? Make sure you burn it straight into your very eyes! Fuhahaha! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Eh… I feel like if that was burned into my retinas, I'd never be able to get a good night's sleep again…&quot;
💚(Ughh, it's so dark… The school at night feels way too creepy… But since Morisawa-senpai dragged me over to the farewell party, I ended up leaving my bag in the classroom, so I have to go back and get it…)
💚(Everyone wanted to have a final match with Morisawa-senpai, I guess… All the underclassmen are fond of him, after all… The only ones who rebelled were me and Akehoshi-senpai…)
💚(Maybe I should've been a little nicer to him before everything was over… But I dunno, even that feels waaay too late… I should leave that to the juniors who always acted in that &quot;I love Morisawa-senpai! ♪&quot; way…)
💚(Especially since it was kinda like I was always keeping &quot;everyone's Morisawa-senpai&quot; to myself… Considering we share the same club and unit, and all… Man, why did he get so involved with me, anyway…?)
💚(Meh, anyway… I was expecting something way more sad for the farewell party, but…It was just a ridiculously cheerful atmosphere from start to end… Morisawa-senpai was also laughing the whole time…)
💚(I thought Morisawa-senpai was gonna make us all cry with a big speech retelling our past memories or something… But in the end, nobody shed a single tear, everyone was just laughing until their whole bodies hurt… It didn't really feel satisfying somehow…)
❤️&quot;………&quot;
💚(…Eep!? Huh!? Morisawa-senpai!?
W-Why's he just standing in the corner, all spaced out…? I almost let out a weird sound 'cause I thought I saw a ghost…)
❤️&quot;………&quot;
💚(Huh…? Is he… crying…? His shoulders are shaking… and I can hear muffled sobs, too… Huh? What's going on…? Why's he crying all alone in the gym in the middle of the night…?)
💚(Huh? What's going on…? Why's he crying all alone in the gym in the middle of the night…?
Ahhh… I feel like I saw something I shouldn't have… I-I gotta leave before he notices me… I don't want him pestering me like he usually does…)
💚(It's not very heroic of me to leave someone crying all alone, though…
Wait, no… I may be a member of Ryuseitai, but I don't recall ever becoming a hero… And since he always wants to look cool for some reason, I don't think he'd want anyone to see him crying anyway…)
💚(Morisawa-senpai.
What's wrong? You're always laughing and yelling about stuff that makes no sense… You're always over-enthusiastic and constantly bothering everyone with everything you do, aren't you…?
It's not like you to sob like that… You know that, right, Senpai?)
❤️&quot;…Hmm? Ohh, that surprised me! So it was you, Takamine! What's up, what's wrong!? Are you on your way home? You shouldn't stay around for so long, y'know! Go back home, brush your teeth, and go to bed!&quot;
💚&quot;Ah—… Um, no, I just left my bag in the classroom, so…&quot;
💚(Huh…? I guess he wasn't crying after all…? He's got that usual dumb-looking smile on his face…
Ah, but there's traces of tears around his eyes… Did he stop himself from crying and force a smile in the short time he noticed me and turned around…?
You're always like this.)
❤️&quot;What's the matter? You don't seem well! Are you sleepy? Sorry for keeping you up late for the farewell party!
Ah, I remember now! Weren't you always too scared to walk alone at night? Alrighty then, let me take you back home! Wait for me, I'll be ready soon!&quot;
❤️&quot;Heh! ♪ Just to let you know, I was cleaning the gym as thanks for all the wonderful memories it gave me the past three years! Showing our gratitude is important, Takamine! Both as a hero and an idol!&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai. ……Is everything alright?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? Is what alright? I don't know what you're referring to, but worry not, Takamine! My engines are always at full throttle for the sake of protecting the peace of the world! Fuhahaha…!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;…I see.&quot;
💚(Ahh… I wonder why I feel this way…? He hasn't done anything wrong… But seeing him smile irritates me to no end for some reason…
Morisawa-senpai, why're you smiling…? You, who loves everyone and is loved by everyone in return… How can you even be smiling right now…?)
💚(Graduation is supposed to be something upsetting, so agonizingly lonely and sad… Yet, are you really gonna try and look cool while parting ways, until the very end…?
No… Even before all this, you've always been—…)
❤️&quot;Takamine? Heeey, what's wrong? Are you feeling down? You're a handsome guy, so seeing you all silent and blank-faced is terrifying!&quot;
💚&quot;No, not really… I'm just a little tired, sleepy, and irritated…&quot;
✨&quot;And like, today… From what I could tell, Chi~chan-senpai and Takamin were both acting a little off. So since I was kinda worried, I tried my best to talk to them, but… I'm just not good at that sorta stuff.&quot;
✨&quot;It's kinda hard to say goodbye with a smile, though~ Takamin is terrible at smiling, for one thing. On the other hand, Chi~chan-senpai's smiling a lot more than he used to last year. …Aren't those two kinda similar?&quot;
🎸&quot;Really? I personally think they're the exact opposite…&quot;
❤️&quot;Nagumo. I don't want to think you would, but did you hit Takamine by any chance? You shouldn't resort to violence!&quot;
🖤&quot;Please don't just assume things. I wouldn't hit him. …I'd only dirty my fists if I punched a spoiled brat like him.&quot;
❤️&quot;D-Did someone get hurt after all…? Nagumo seems to be unharmed, so is Takamine the one who got hit? I'll help patch him up! Stand up, Takamine! Show me where it hurts! I often get injured during my stunt work, so I know how to treat small injuries!&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh, you're so loud… I'm not injured anywhere, okay… You're all panicking way too much…&quot;
❤️&quot;Then why are you crying? Anzu, Sengoku, please give me a full report of what happened!&quot;
🖤&quot;You never wanted to become an idol in the first place, right, Midori-kun? So scolding you so harshly, pushing you to do stuff, and forcefully dragging you back in when you're so unmotivated would just be cruel. That's exactly what Taichou always did, though.&quot;
🖤&quot;Taichou would always pretend to be a terrible, insensitive person — giving you pep talk after pep talk, and pulling you on stage even though you hated it. That became an everyday occurrence in Ryuseitai.&quot;
🖤&quot;But I was wrong. Y'know, I really can't do what Taichou does. I just don't have it in me to sacrifice myself for another person's sake — especially if it meant I'd be hated and found annoying 'cuz of it.
I can't do all'a that just to drag Midori-kun along by force.&quot;
🖤&quot;But y'know, Midori-kun… Let me ask you something! Exactly what was this whole year to you?
Taichou went to pick you up every day! He was always there to help you get through the day, even though you had zero motivation!&quot;
🖤&quot;Taichou went to pick you up every day! He was always there to help you get through the day, even though you had zero motivation! Did all'a that effort he spent, running around and encouraging you, just go to waste?&quot;
🖤&quot;Taichou completely used up his last precious year in high school just to try and hone our skills, y'know! Are you saying all'a that was just a waste of time?&quot;
🖤&quot;I was hoping that you were just embarrassed, that deep down it might've all meant somethin' to you! But if you're telling me that it was all just a waste, that you really meant it when you said you hated everything and wanted to die…
Then what was Taichou's whole year for!?&quot;
🖤&quot;I know that nobody asked Taichou to do any of that — that he's the one who decided to do all of that on his own — If that's what you're thinking, it's true! But the way you've been acting is just too much!&quot;
🖤&quot;Taichou was expecting so much from you! You, who's so much more talented than me! So much more handsome than me! To be honest, as one of your classmates, it makes me super jealous!&quot;
🖤&quot;I wish I could've been born to look like you! I'm sure Taichou feels the same way! We were so envious and so captivated by you! We wanted to see you shine even more! But all along, were we just pushing our own selfish wishes onto you?&quot;
🖤&quot;If that was really the case — If you really hated it that much—! You should've left before you ate away an entire year of Taichou's life! You should've quit everything and just disappeared!&quot;
🖤&quot;Our seniors helped you so much, and you owe 'em so much, but you refuse to pay that back? Just 'cuz you can't bother yourself to do something you don't like?
Hey, Midori-kun… Just how long do you plan to keep being a little brat!?&quot;
❤️&quot;…Takamine. I want to hear how you truly feel. I won't know if you don't say anything. Was it really all a nuisance? Did I really just cause you suffering throughout this whole year?&quot;
❤️&quot;If so, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll give you a proper apology, and I'll do anything I can to make it up to you.
I won't mind if you think of our meeting as nothing but an unfortunate accident and forget it ever happened.&quot;
❤️&quot;I won't mind if you think of our meeting as nothing but an unfortunate accident and forget it ever happened.
If that's what would give you relief and make you smile again, then I'm fine with that… because your smile is the greatest treasure in this whole world.&quot;
❤️&quot;…Because your smile is the greatest treasure in this whole world.
I would always look forward to making that shine at its brightest. But if I was truly just a nuisance to you all along, then… I apologize. I'm so sorry, Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm pretty sure I've always said this before, though… That you're annoying, that I don't wanna do any of it, that it's all a pain… But you never, ever listen…
Morisawa-senpai… Is there really anything worthwhile about me…?&quot;
💚&quot;I thought the same thing would happen with you… I thought you'd get disappointed and lose all interest in someone like me… Something like that is only natural… That's why I always had an escape ready…&quot;
💚&quot;I thought you'd get disappointed and lose all interest in someone like me… Something like that is only natural… That's why I always had an escape ready… The only notable thing about me is my appearance… There's no way anyone could ever love me for who I really am…&quot;
💚&quot;And yet, you go ahead and put all your hopes into someone pathetic like me!
I feel like a horrible, miserable person for making Morisawa-senpai waste a whole year of his life on me!&quot;
💚&quot;Did you know? Morisawa-senpai was so upset about leaving that he cried all alone where no one could see him! But he intended to hide those tears from us to the very end! He wanted to say goodbye with a smile, as a hero — and to leave us with nothing but happy memories!&quot;
💚&quot;He wanted to say goodbye with a smile, as a hero — and to leave us with nothing but happy memories! Are you insane!? That's way too cool! What are you, some kind of saint!?
And I—! I wasted an entire precious year of someone as amazing as that…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Good morning! Excuse me, I'd like vegetables! Anything is fine, as long as it isn't eggplants!&quot;
💙&quot;good mooorning~ i would like some fish~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Huh!? What are you two doing…?&quot;
💚&quot;Umm… Repayment Festival has already started… Are you sure it's okay not to go and support Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun…? They're doing their very best to repay you, y'know…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep! Of course we plan to go and support them!&quot;
💚&quot;This always happens since Yumenosaki is so nearby… Every time there's a big DreamFes going on, I'm also dragged around to do work all over…&quot;
❤️&quot;Mhm, so it seems. I talk to your parents often, so I'm aware of that.&quot;
❤️&quot;You really do have normal parents. So it doesn't sink in when explaining to them that their son is now a popular idol.
My parents are the same. When I tell them that I've got a lot of tough jobs, they always reply with something like 'Look at you, sounding like an adult! ♪'&quot;
❤️&quot;But don't you want to prove to your parents that you've become an adult despite that? Don't you want to show them how much you've grown?&quot;
💚&quot;Umm… What do you mean…? I don't really get what you're trying to say…&quot;
❤️&quot;Right now, in Yumenosaki, there's work that only you can do. So go now and do it. That's all I can say — all I can ask of you.
I'm in no position to forcibly pull you by the hand anymore, so all I can do now is hope, like how one puts hope upon a shooting star.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm sure there are a lot of other juniors who wanna say their thanks to you as well, not just Ryuseitai… I feel really bad, making you two waste your time on me…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;Fweh—? Huh!? What is it!? Your face is way too close! You're always like this…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;Fweh—? Huh!? What is it!? Your face is way too close! You're always like this…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Sorry. You never react much, so I always end up thinking you couldn't hear me well.&quot;
❤️&quot;If you don't like my face being this close, then reply back. At least go &quot;yeah&quot; or &quot;mhm&quot; back.
Don't ignore me, it feels lonely.&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't worry, I won't say anything that'd hurt you. Though I suppose you're thinking that's just a load of garbage, especially after all the stress that I've put you through.&quot;
💚&quot;………&quot;
❤️&quot;You have to go now, they're all waiting for you. …Leave this place to us.&quot;
💚&quot;But…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine. I was a sickly child, so I always caused trouble for my family. That's why I wanted to be a great idol — to earn money and make things easier for my parents.&quot;
❤️&quot;That was the reason at first. That's how everyone is at first. People aren't always aiming to be an idol because of a big dream or ideal. That's why, Takamine, there's no need to look down on yourself.&quot;
❤️&quot;Dreams don't even come true most of the time — though I could never say that in front of children, even if they pried my mouth open.
Everyone's like that, it isn't just you… Takamine.&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine. The reason I tried to make Ryuseitai into a strong unit was because… I wanted to be able to say I was the leader of a veteran unit.
I wanted to earn high marks for this unit, so that I could use it to my advantage when I graduate. That's how it was at first.&quot;
❤️&quot;You're a considerate person, Takamine, so benefiting from the unit's value… might have felt wrong for you. But it isn't something to feel guilty about at all. That's what units are for.&quot;
❤️&quot;Units exist so that, together, we can climb up to a place we wouldn't be able to reach on our own. It's the same with you, Takamine; there's no need to feel guilty at all.&quot;
❤️&quot;Was this year you spent with Ryuseitai not fun for you? Was it nothing but a pain? Was it only irritating? Were you always unhappy? If not, then you shouldn't be staying here!
Run! Run now, Takamine! Isn't there something only you can do for the sake of your beloved friends!?&quot;
❤️&quot;This is the last time I'll act like your superior and lecture you like a know-it-all! So don't ignore me! Listen to me!
I'm begging you, Takamine, please go save my beloved comrades! Both Nagumo and Sengoku are still struggling! They're in grave danger and need your help!&quot;
❤️&quot;So go now! Run, Takamine! It's the hero's turn to shine! Your filler arc is over now, so go fight for the sake of your world's peace!
Gooo, Ryusei Green! Make our wishes come true…!!&quot;
💚&quot;Umm… As usual, nothing you say makes any sense… or it's like you're shouting with so much energy that I have no idea what's going on… But I guess I've gotten used to it… I sort of get what you're trying to say…&quot;
💚&quot;…I'll go to Yumenosaki. I don't know what I can do, but… I've been encouraged all the way to this point—If I cower back… If I run away now, I really will end up looking way too uncool.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yes! You're a good boy, Takamine! Hang in there, hero! Don't lose now, hero…!! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Yes! You're a good boy, Takamine! Hang in there, hero! Don't lose now, hero…!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Don't shout… See, now people are probably wondering what's going on and looking at us… There's gonna be rumors now… so depressing…&quot;
💚&quot;If people start saying bad things to the point where I can't live here anymore… then please take responsibility, Morisawa-senpai…&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep! Leave it to me, I'm always welcome! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Does this guy even know what he's saying…&quot;
💚&quot;Is it really okay to leave the greengrocer to you two…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yes. Your family and I have already talked it over. They accepted and supported it. They even apologized since they felt like they've given you a lot of grief. They're good people. Cherish them well, Takamine.&quot;
❤️&quot;First things first: try to do your very best as an idol. If you ever lose track of your path, or can't progress any further, then come back here. Your family will always be here to welcome you back.&quot;
❤️&quot;You have a tough, yet warm family. So what exactly is dissatisfying for you, Takamine? What's so 'depressing'!? What's making you 'want to die'!? Is this really the time to be dying!? Enjoy your life to the fullest, just like your family wants you to!&quot;
❤️&quot;What's so 'depressing'!? What's making you 'want to die'!? Is this really the time to be dying!? Enjoy your life to the fullest, just like your family wants you to!
Promise me that. This is my wish right now, so please make it come true, Ryuseitai.&quot;
❤️&quot;Promise me that. This is my wish right now, so please make it come true, Ryuseitai.&quot;
💚&quot;You're still part of Ryuseitai, aren't you…? So will you make my wish come true, too…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? I don't mind, tell me anything! I'll do what I can!&quot;
💚&quot;You're still part of Ryuseitai, aren't you…? So will you make my wish come true, too…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? I don't mind, tell me anything! I'll do what I can!&quot;
💚&quot;Then please make sure you two come back to Yumenosaki later, okay?&quot;
💚&quot;Then please make sure you two come back to Yumenosaki later, okay? Repayment Festival is for saying thanks to our seniors, so if you're not there, it'll be a little awkward… And from what I understood from Anzu-san, we may have a present for you that you'll enjoy a lot…&quot;
❤️&quot;Aren't we supposed to be the ones to give Anzu something on White Day?&quot;
💚&quot;Yes… That's all the more reason why you have to come to the live show… It's something even Anzu-san would enjoy; an unbelievable unfolding of events straight from a tokusatsu awaits you…♪&quot;
✨&quot;Heheh, Chi~chan-senpai's number one favorite may be Takamin and all, but… It still does frustrate me a little that Takamin gets to have everything for himself. And it looks like he's gonna become the exact kinda hero Chi~chan-senpai hoped for…&quot;
✨&quot;It looks like Takamin's gonna become the exact kinda hero Chi~chan-senpai hoped for, so… maybe I should become the exact kinda idol Chi~chan-senpai hoped for.
That'll be our repayment to him, and today will mark the memory of that first step.&quot;
💚&quot;Ryusei Kiiick~♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhaha! Worry not, Takamine! The greengrocer store is also thriving! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh, there you go again with doing needless—… You're always like this… I guess I can't really complain though, not when you did it in my place…&quot;
💚&quot;Ahaha, you're sounding like a leader…♪&quot;
🖤&quot;You got a complaint 'bout that? Ah, could it be that you wanted to be the next Ryusei Red?
You've always been real close with Taichou, after all… It wouldn't be strange if you've been thinking of inheriting that color all along.&quot;
❤️&quot;The red flame is——Gwah!?&quot;
💚&quot;……&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh? Um, Takamine? Why did you kick my butt? Did I do something wrong!? Are you angry!?&quot;
💚&quot;Hmph… Well, I do dislike the way you're walking on eggshells around me… You don't have to worry so much, jeez… You're way too late for that…&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai. I'll at least be honest with you now. I owe you a lot for this whole year.
You may have always been annoying, suffocating, clingy, gross, loud, unpleasant, troublesome, and really gross, but—&quot;
❤️&quot;You said it twice! You said 'gross' twice!!&quot;
💚&quot;But. I think I was also an unpleasant junior who was always lazy and kept snapping back… So, well… Let's just call it even.&quot;
💚&quot;All the kindness you've given me — Even if I spent my whole life trying, I don't think I could ever fully return the favor. But at the very least, I'll prove to you that your year didn't go to waste.
Thanks to you, even I've changed a little… and I'll show that to you now.&quot;
💚&quot;When we first met, you asked me, 'Won't you become a hero?'
And I never gave you an answer… But now I'll answer you not with words, but with actions.&quot;
💚&quot;Even if I did say it with words, you wouldn't listen anyway…… So please watch my transformation closely.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah! That's Kuuga! That's Kamen Rider Kuuga's line!&quot;
💚&quot;Shut it.&quot;
❤️(Takamine.
Ahaha, you finally properly introduced yourself… Even though you always said it was too embarrassing and you didn't get it… You whined that you didn't want to do it, only doing it as you pleased…
So that's your answer, Takamine. Ahh, I'm glad. I'm so relieved.)
❤️(Ahaha… No good, I really didn't want to cry until after graduation, not in front of the kids at least… But my vision is getting blurry already.)
💚&quot;Hey, come on… This isn't the time to be crying, please finish what you have to do. We'd like to hear your usual catchphrase.&quot;
💚&quot;Hey, come on… This isn't the time to be crying, please finish what you have to do. We'd like to hear your usual catchphrase. Please shine in your own way, as you always have—within the center of everyone.
I never really disliked seeing that… Morisawa-senpai.&quot;
💚&quot;Please shine in your own way, as you always have — within the center of everyone. I never really disliked seeing that… Morisawa-senpai.&quot;
❤️&quot;I see, so that's how it was all along… That's good, I'm glad. Ahh, I'm just so glad.&quot;
❤️&quot;I truly feel rewarded. To be a hero means to not ask for anything in return… but if I've been loved and thanked, and brought a smile to someone who was crying—
Then there was value and reason to the desperate fight it took to reach here after all.
Thank you.&quot;
Produce Courses
❤️&quot;Mm, I can't believe Takamine saw me that day… I'm embarrassed at how hard I tried to put up a front to be cool… It actually makes me look pathetic instead, doesn't it…?&quot;
💚&quot;I saw something I shouldn't have seen… I dunno what I'm supposed to do in times like these… I wish I could just erase my memory of it entirely…&quot;
🎀&quot;What was it?&quot;
💚&quot;Um, I saw someone crying, even though he's never the type to…&quot;
💚&quot;I saw something I shouldn't have seen… I dunno what I'm supposed to do… I wish I could just erase my memory of it entirely…&quot;
🎀&quot;What was it?&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, um… I don't think I can tell others… It might've been my imagination anyway… I'd rather keep this to myself for now.&quot;
🎀&quot;It's because of everyone's bonds!&quot;
💚&quot;Of course! They're my comrades who fought alongside me for a whole year, after all!
—I bet that's what Morisawa-senpai would say… Something must be wrong with me if I really imitated him of all people…&quot;
Sparkly First Years
(10, incomplete)
💚&quot;I actually wanted to go home straight away, but I didn't want Morisawa-senpai invading my life all the way back home… so I figured he'd be satisfied enough if I played basketball with him…&quot;
💚&quot;The moment I entered the school, Morisawa-senpai came to my classroom and yelled stuff like, 'Ossu! My name is Morisawa Chiaki, and I'm the captain of the Basketball Club! Starting today, you'll be joining us at the club! It's nice to meet youuu~♪'…&quot;
💚&quot;He was so insistent to get me to join the club that I was starting to get tired of refusing him every time…&quot;
💚&quot;I figured he'd finally stop invading my classroom if I joined the Basketball Club, and for a moment, I was relieved… until he was like, 'Takamine, won't you become a hero? You've got the qualities of a hero! I'm certain of it, you're meant to be!'&quot;
💚&quot;Now he always comes to my classroom, no matter if it's during lunch break, after school, or whatever else… I'm so depressed, I wanna die…&quot;
💚&quot;Ughhh, the noisy guy's back…&quot;
❤️&quot;Wait, hold on a moment! I know something we can practice with just the two of us~♪ You're a beginner at basketball, right? Then I'll just have to show you aaall the ropes…☆&quot;
💚&quot;No thanks. That's honestly the last thing I'd ever wanna do.&quot;
💚&quot;Umm, Morisawa-senpai. Can I seriously not go home…? My parents will yell at me if I don't get back soon…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, is it that late already? That's too bad—I was really hoping we could deepen our bonds today!&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, what a relief… There's unit practice tomorrow, right…? Can I skip it?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, no.&quot;
❤️&quot;Good morning, comrades~♪ The weather feels so refreshing today…☆ Mhm, my luck sure is perfect! I got to see Takamine and Sengoku early in the morning!&quot;
💚&quot;And my luck's hit rock bottom just now…&quot;
Biblio
(1, incomplete)
💚&quot;I get nervous just remembering that glasses-vice-president is an upperclassman or part of the Student Council… Whenever Morisawa-senpai does something dumb, he scolds him with a death glare…&quot;
Shooting Star Festival
(6, incomplete)
🖤&quot;Oh, it's only Sengoku-kun here? What 'bout Taichou? It's rare for that guy to be late.&quot;
💛&quot;Taichou-dono has gone to pick up Midori-kun from his house. He said that since Midori-kun wasn't answering his phone calls, it'd be faster to just head over there in person.&quot;
💛&quot;Taichou-dono said that since Midori-kun wasn't picking up his phone calls, it'd be faster to just head over to him in person.&quot;
🖤&quot;Oh yeah… Back in PirateFes, he did manage to bring him over, so we can be at ease with Midori-kun in Taichou's hands, huh?&quot;
❤️&quot;Sorry for keeping you all waiting! C'mon, Takamine, don't cling to the door; get inside!&quot;
💚&quot;Uuu… I was falling back to sleep in my air-conditioned room when Morisawa-senpai loudly woke me up from bed… and then I got dragged all the way here…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine, no! Didn't I say I wanted to talk this out with everyone? You're included in that 'everyone'. Make sure you participate, alright?&quot;
💚&quot;Your face's way too close! Uuu, you don't have any proper sense of distance… Please move away, it's seriously suffocating…&quot;
❤️&quot;Ooh, Sengoku! Nagumo and Takamine, too! Have you been doing well?&quot;
💚&quot;This isn't some kinda reunion after years of not seeing each other… Wh—Please don't try to hug me. You stink of sweat, 'kay…?&quot;
💚&quot;Wh—Please don't try to hug me. You stink of sweat, 'kay…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Ha ha ha, sorry! I was working under the sweltering hot sun, and it's easy to sweat even when you're standing still. The sweat after a nice workout feels good, y'know! ♪&quot;
💚&quot;Um, I don't need that sportsy energy…&quot;
Sweet Halloween
(46, complete)
💚&quot;You seem down lately, Morisawa-senpai… What's wrong…? I mean, usually it's depression with me, but it can't be something like that with you, right…?&quot;
💚&quot;Umm, so basically, we'll be staying at school all day? I live nearby, so it's not like I'd miss out on much if I just slept at my own home instead…&quot;
❤️&quot;If that's more comfortable for you, then it's fine, Takamine.&quot;
❤️&quot;Is yours alright, too, Takamine? You mentioned that you grew taller recently, right?&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, yeah, it's alright… The outfit's made of stretchy material, anyway…&quot;
💚&quot;Is it just me, or is Morisawa-senpai acting weird lately…?&quot;
💛&quot;Is he not always weird?&quot;
💚&quot;No, like… he's not acting like himself… It's like he's always scared of something… He seems so nervous that he's overwhelmed… He doesn't even pester me as much as he used to…&quot;
💚&quot;He doesn't even pester me as much as he used to…&quot;
🖤&quot;Oh? Could it be that you're feeling lonely~? 'Cuz he's not paying attention to you~♪&quot;
💚&quot;……&quot;
💛&quot;Wh—!? What are you going to do with that hammer, Midori-kun!? You could kill someone with that, you know!?&quot;
💚&quot;But no, really… Hasn't Morisawa-senpai been kinda off…?&quot;
🖤&quot;Yeah, now that you mention it… He has been a li'l quieter than usual lately. He hasn't been his usual positive self… I mean, he didn't seem pumped up 'bout participating in the Halloween Party, either.&quot;
💚&quot;Oh yeah, he never even mentioned Halloween Party until Tetora-kun asked him whether we'd be joining it, right…? He'd usually be excited to get things going, and poke his nose in everyone else's business… Like, that's how we got ourselves involved with Quarrel Fes, right…&quot;
❤️&quot;If we keep going at our current pace, it'll look like we were slacking off! So let's do our best! Let's go, we can do it! Put all your energy into it! Fuhaha!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Mm…? He really is acting weird… Or like, he's trying really, really hard to seem as energetic as possible…&quot;
❤️&quot;My beloved comrades! What are you all doing over in that corner? Let us take part in it, too~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Eughhh, here comes the loud one…&quot;
❤️&quot;Besides, uh, there's no TV in the dojo! So you can't watch a movie, right!?&quot;
💚&quot;That's okay, I brought over what we need… There was an extra monitor in the AV room, and I got permission to use it…&quot;
❤️&quot;Gahhh!? You really are amazing, Takamine…! So kind and strong…!&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, aren't you the one who always forces us to watch tokusatsu shows so we can learn how to act more heroic…? It's the same as that… What, do you have a problem or something?&quot;
❤️&quot;N-No? Nope, none at all! Quite the opposite! It's wonderful that you're all working so hard!&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah! My bad! I-I think I've gotten sleepy too! Can I go and get some rest? Is it okay if I do that!?&quot;
💚&quot;Oh no no… Don't be like that~ Let's all watch the movie together…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;T-Takamine? Your face looks mischievous! Why's that!? Did I do something to make you angry again!?&quot;
💚&quot;Weaknesses…? So Morisawa-senpai really is bad with scary stuff…?&quot;
❤️&quot;O-Of course not! There's nothing a hero's afraid of! Ahh, I'm so excited~! We're going to watch a horror movie~! Come on, let's get the movie started!&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, I totally know what you mean… That's how you know the character's gonna die…&quot;
❤️&quot;H-He won't die, right!? He survived this long! You're just lying when you say he's gonna die, right!?&quot;
💚&quot;Heeey, Morisawa-senpai…? Come on out from under your blankets~ You're being rude to the movie makers by missing out on the climax, y'know~? ♪&quot;
❤️&quot;No! It's scary! I don't wanna see any more blood and guts!&quot;
❤️&quot;No! It's scary! I don't wanna see any more blood and guts!&quot;
💚&quot;You always force us to watch hero stuff when we never even wanted to, though…? So there's no reason why you should be the only one to get away with saying that, right…?&quot;
❤️&quot;U-Uuu! It hurts when you say that!&quot;
💚&quot;(whispering) So you really are bad with horror, Morisawa-senpai… That's why you don't seem to like Halloween either, right…? Since it has lots of monsters…&quot;
❤️&quot;Uuu~? No, you're wrong! I'm fine! Horror movies don't scare me one bit!&quot;
💚&quot;Then why exactly're you tugging on my sleeve and shaking in fear…? Wait a sec… Didn't you yell 'It's scary!' just now…?&quot;
❤️&quot;N-No! You misunderstand, Takamine! 'Sca-ree' in Swahili means 'really interesting'!&quot;
💚&quot;In Swahili…? I can't wait to see what your next excuse will be…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Anyway, there really isn't anything to be embarrassed about… We all have things we can't stand… In a way, it's more embarrassing and uncool to keep insisting that you like something you actually hate…&quot;
💚&quot;It's natural to have dislikes… Just be true to yourself… Aren't you the one who's always telling me stuff like, 'I love you no matter what'…?&quot;
❤️&quot;? What was that, Takamine? Sorry, I can't hear you very well from under the blankets!&quot;
💚&quot;Nevermind… It wasn't important, so…&quot;
💚&quot;It feels like Morisawa-senpai gets really anxious without you around… So please don't just disappear out of nowhere…&quot;
💙&quot;fufufu, that is because chiaki is more spoiled than you would expect. but it looks like it will be okay, since it seems like midori is protecting him.&quot;
❤️&quot;…Eeek!! Something just creeped down my back!! S-Something cold! I'm scared! It's scary! I'm scared!!&quot;
💚&quot;It's the air conditioning… We made sure to decorate around the vents without blocking them, remember…? Seriously, are you gonna be alright for this…?&quot;
💚&quot;Seriously, are you gonna be alright for this…?&quot;
❤️&quot;I-I-I-I'm fine! Ghosts don't exist! They're just something people see when they're half asleep!&quot;
💚&quot;Ahaha… Morisawa-senpai's acting just like a little kid at a haunted house…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai, you really are bad with monsters, huh…? I'm not really good with them either, but seeing someone who's more afraid than me ends up making me feel calm instead…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Here you go… We're going to have a live show at the concert hall, so please come over and watch if you can…♪&quot;
🖤&quot;C'mon, Taichou! You gotta give out candy and advertise! Look, even Midori-kun's working hard for once!&quot;
❤️&quot;S-S-Sorry! But I really can't handle scary things…!&quot;
💛&quot;Of course, I see my seniors as people I should respect and aim to be like, anyway! ♪&quot;
💚&quot;Ehh~… So you even respect Morisawa-senpai, Sengoku-kun…? I don't see what anyone could find respectable about him this time around, though…?&quot;
💚&quot;Like, seriously… so what if you're scared of ghosts… If you just told us about it faster, we could've avoided being worried over nothing… We would've just thought, 'Wait, that's it?', laughed it off, and called it a day…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh! So you were worried about me, Takamine! That makes me happy! I was a little nervous that you might not care about me, since you always act so harshly towards me, but in the end, you really do love me as a comrade! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;I was a little nervous you might not care about me, since you always act so harshly towards me, but in the end, you really do love me as a comrade! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;……&quot;
❤️&quot;Wh—!? T-Takamine? Takamine-kun, could you please not shove that giant eyeball in my face…?&quot;
💙&quot;fufu, do not bully chiaki so much, midori~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Mhm… But I just wanna get a tinsy bit more of my revenge for all the times he's pestered me…♪&quot;
🖤&quot;Ahaha, the two's positions are completely switched around this time~&quot;
❤️&quot;Uuu… Dr. Shinigami is super scary… The air he gives off feels so intense that it's just terrifying.&quot;
💚&quot;Ahaha… Yeah, liking something doesn't mean you'll love every single thing about it… I'm like that, too… I'm not gonna be okay with anything just 'cause it's a mascot…&quot;
💛&quot;We apologize for taking so long to arrive. Taichou-dono kept trying to flee whenever he saw a monster on the way over here~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah… It was seriously a pain just getting here…&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm so, so sorry! I haven't been able to do anything right during this event!&quot;
💚&quot;Ahaha, it's unusual for Morisawa-senpai to be useless, but I feel like I got to be useful instead… I got a lot of attention from the guests, and they kept asking me to take pictures with them…&quot;
💚&quot;Maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing a costume, but I didn't feel embarrassed about it, either…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep! It's just a regular costume for this event, but! Whenever we shout 'Transform!', we are reborn into a new being!&quot;
❤️&quot;Heheh~♪ I'm so happy to know you got to understand what heroes are, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;Why're you talking like you're so wise… You're looking really pathetic right now, so nothing you say sounds even the tiniest bit convincing, 'kay…?&quot;
💚&quot;Why're you talking like you're wise… You're looking really pathetic right now, so nothing you say sounds even the tiniest bit convincing, 'kay…? Please get things done heroically, alright? At least before the live show ends…&quot;
❤️&quot;Alright! Leave it to me! Justice will prevail…!&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, I see now… There were zombie dogs in some of the movies we watched with everyone…&quot;
❤️&quot;Wha— Don't remind me! Eeek—!! I still can't get the image out of my head! The window…! There's a hand on the window…!?&quot;
💚&quot;Wow, that's kinda cute… That sort of thing is just like Ra*bits…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Really? I find that super scary! Moving stuffed toys are terrifying!&quot;
🖤&quot;We gotta work just as hard, too, Midori-kun~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah… But I'm starting to feel tired all of a sudden… Those two weeks were rough… I'm also tired from worrying so much about how off Morisawa-senpai was acting…
🖤&quot;Heheh, Taichou was pretty much useless this time, but Midori-kun's been making up for it by shining way more than usual. We surprisingly always balance ourselves out.&quot;
Produce Courses
💚&quot;Ahh… I had nothing to do, so I practiced free throws… 'Cause there was a ball here… Mm? I'm enjoying my youth?
Uu, please don't, Anzu-san… Associating every little thing to 'youth' reminds me of a certain somebody, and I don't like it…&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, you want to know if we decided on a Halloween costume…? We haven't yet… We literally just started, if anything…
But if this were the usual, Morisawa-senpai would've gladly told us lots of ideas… More specifically, he would've pushed his opinions on us…&quot;
🎀&quot;What's wrong?&quot;
💚&quot;Mm~ I'm not really sure, but… Morisawa-senpai has been acting kinda strange lately… Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun say that's the usual for him, but… Sooomething about it doesn't feel right to me, if you get me…? Well, whatever, I guess…&quot;
🎀&quot;I'll come over to check how things are going again.&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh… Did I make you worry…? I'll be fine, probably… My motivation isn't that low or anything. If anything, it's Morisawa-senpai who seems out of it, so please come check up on him…&quot;
💚&quot;I asked Tetora-kun to teach me how to do Kenpo moves, and I used it on Morisawa-senpai to motivate him to work hard… That was a good time…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, I hope the juniors felt something! No, I'll believe in it…☆ Mhm, mhm. I feel like I was endlessly teased throughout the sleepover party, but I'll believe in them!
Especially Takamine. I feel like he was grinning with glee the more I felt upset, but… I believe in him!&quot;

💚(I'm pretty sure the Basketball Club has today off, though… Hmm…? Am I remembering things wrong…?
Maybe I should double-check when I'm done, just in case… Since Morisawa-senpai gets really annoying when I skip out on the club…)
💚(Hmm~… The number on the uniform is four… Which means this is Morisawa-senpai's, I guess… But he's not really the type to just go home without tidying up after himself… Maybe he just went to the bathroom…?)
💚&quot;Hmm… This is some student's notebook… The handwriting is super cluttered… Whose is this…?
Geh—This is Morisawa-senpai's notebook…?”
💚(I don't get what it's trying to tell me… It's starting to hit its paws on the notebook's photo of Morisawa-senpai for some reason…? Yeah yeah~… Get 'im~ Punch him real good~…♪)
💚(Hm… The doggie slipped into Morisawa-senpai's uniform and started playing with the ball… Looks like it's having fun… It kinda reminds me of someone I know… Wait—Could it be…?)
&quot;Um… I honestly doubt it, but… are you Senpai…?&quot;
💚&quot;Um… I honestly doubt it, but… are you Senpai…? Ahh—! I told you not to bark! Was that a 'yes'…?
No way… That kind of magic doesn't exist in real life… Then again, a book I borrowed from the library had a story like that… But… Ehhh…? Ughh… I guess it could exist…?&quot;
💚&quot;Um… Tell me if I'm right, okay…?
Morisawa-senpai, did you transform into a dog…?&quot;
💚(Crap… I just stuffed Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog) into my cardigan without thinking… It's struggling around for air… The Vice President is gonna get suspicious…)
💚(Ehhh…? The health department is coming…? No, this is awful timing! They'll euthanize Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog) if they find him…!?
No, that's just too much…… I have to save him…)
💚(T-That was a ridiculously heroic rescue scene just now… And I didn't even save a cute heroine or anything, it was just a dog… This whole situation's so weird…… Ughhh, what am I gonna do now…?)
💚&quot;Hm…? What's wrong, Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog)…? You sound like you're whining… Are you… worried about me…?&quot;
💚&quot;You're always like this, aren't you… Even though you're the one who's in hot water here, after turning… transforming…? into a dog…
You're always, always worrying and fussing over other people all the time…&quot;
💚&quot;You're always, always worrying and fussing over other people all the time… That's why I think it'd be terrible if something bad happened to you… Um, like… I can't put it into words well, but… It just wouldn't be fair…&quot;
💚&quot;It'll be okay… I'll do something about this, so don't worry… For now, I'll keep you safe at my house until the health department's gone…&quot;
💚&quot;I'll do something about this and turn you back to normal… Back to your silly, peaceful daily life…
So don't look so anxious… Everything will be okay… There, there…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Uhya—Ahaha… Please don't lick me just 'cause you're a dog now… The moment I remember it's actually Morisawa-senpai in there, it starts to feel really gross…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Heheh, I'm feeling hungry after running all the way here… It's noon by now, so it's time for some lunch anyway… You'll have eggplants for lunch, Morisawa-senpai… Just kidding~♪
I'm kidding, I'm kidding… You hate eggplants, after all…&quot;
💚(Huh…? Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog) is happily sniffing the eggplant… and licking it…? That's weird… He always freezes up at the sight of eggplants…
Maybe turning into a dog made his taste buds change…? Huh…? Have I made a huge misunderstanding right from the start…?)
💚&quot;Hah… Um, so this dog really isn't Morisawa-senpai, huh…?&quot;
✨&quot;…? Why're you bringing up Chi~chan-senpai? I don't get what you mean, but this here's Daikichi!&quot;
✨&quot;By the time I got back, I heard you'd taken Daikichi away, so I had to come here for him!&quot;
💚&quot;B-But he had Morisawa-senpai's notebook and uniform for some reason…?&quot;
✨&quot;Ahh, Chi~chan-senpai was also practicing with me! We've been there together since this morning!&quot;
✨&quot;Takamin, you smell like Chi~chan-senpai, so Daikichi might've thought the stuff belonged to you…?&quot;
💚&quot;I smell like that guy…? N-no……&quot;
✨&quot;Well, don't you? Since he's always hugging you!&quot;
Boarding Live

❤️&quot;Mm? Do ships not interest you, Takamine? You looked really motivated back at PirateFes though, didn't you? I thought it's because you got to perform on a ship, but was I wrong?&quot;
💚&quot;That's just 'cause I had a reward, yuruchara to be specific…&quot;
💚&quot;Uu… Just hearing the word 'luxury cruise ship' feels nerve-racking…&quot;
❤️&quot;Worry not, Takamine! I've never been on a luxury cruise ship, either! We're the same! It's so comforting to share something in common! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;It's extremely uncomforting for me…&quot;
💚&quot;Hah… The weather's nice, but the wind's cold… Maybe I'll stay in the ship…&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm? Ooh, Takamine! Your happiness will fly out if you sigh! You should just laugh off the cold! Fuhahaha!&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh, the annoying guy is here… Please don't start pestering me, Morisawa-senpai…&quot;
❤️&quot;Sorry for being late, everyone!&quot;
💛&quot;Ahaha, you actually came earlier than the appointed time! …Huh? Midori-kun and Shinkai-dono are also with you.&quot;
❤️&quot;I went to pick up Takamine, and as for Kanata, we met him on the way.&quot;
💚&quot;Uu~… I wanted to sleep until the last second…&quot;

School Festival 4
(11, complete)
❤️&quot;Feel free to tell me any of your opinions…! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Oh, you're allowing us to…? Then I say we don't join the festival…&quot;
❤️&quot;Well done, Takamine! Glad to hear your opinion first! But I've already handed in the papers! We're going to do a food truck, no matter what!&quot;
❤️&quot;What do you guys want for the food? C'mon, c'mon~ Let me hear all your thoughts…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhh… So you're just gonna ignore my thoughts…&quot;
💚&quot;You're the one who was like, 'When it comes to festivals, you think food stalls!', then decided on everything on your own to drag us all into it… How about you think about how we feel…&quot;
❤️&quot;Sorry! I'll make sure to do things only after I've talked to you guys, so forgive me!&quot;
❤️&quot;I haven't cooked much, either! But it's okay! We can do it if we practice! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ahhh, dammit! So you really didn't think this through…!&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai, let's at least drop the food truck idea… It'll only be a disaster like this…&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't give up, Takamine! We just need it to be food we can make, right? Right, right! Our options have gone down by a lot!&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm fine with this. With cotton candy, we could ask for bags with our faces printed on them, and advertise our unit!&quot;
💚&quot;Don't… I'll tear every bag apart if you do that…&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't glare at me like that, you're scaring me!&quot;
💚&quot;You're dragging us into something annoying again… Who cares about that… Can't we just patrol normally…&quot;
❤️&quot;You should care! There are all kinds of visitors coming—We can't let this perfect chance slide!&quot;
❤️&quot;We could wear a happi with our unit written on it, or carry around signboards… How about it? It'll attract attention for sure!&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't suggest stupid stuff… I'll lose all will to live if I'm seen like that…&quot;
❤️&quot;Umm… I thought it was a good idea, though…&quot;
💚&quot;Then how about if Morisawa-senpai plays the victim role…? Though that has its own problems…&quot;
❤️&quot;Now, now! We become stronger with every hardship! That's what being a hero's all about…! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;We're idols, not heroes… Wait no, being an idol is annoying too… Ughhh, everything about this is a big no… I just wanna die…&quot;
❤️&quot;Are you alright, Takamine? You look exhausted. Go and take a rest on that chair!&quot;
💚&quot;M-Morisawa-senpai…? And Nagumo-kun came back, too… Y-You saved me… I almost lost all hope in this world and was ready to die…&quot;

❤️&quot;What's up, Takamine, what's wrong!? Why are you slouching in the corner there!? Did something sad happen to you? Alright, don't worry, I'll share my energy with you! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ack—You're hot! It's not suffocating—it's literally like you're a burning hot pan…! Are you okay, Morisawa-senpai…? Do you have a fever or something…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhaha! I see, I see! You too are a hero who loves peace! ☆ I feel the same way Takaminee~! We're the same! We're one in body and soul! Let's keep working hard together! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh you're hot, you're insanely hot! Are you some heat power generator!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah, no. It's just something I don't want Takamine to hear, so we'll talk about it in a cafe.&quot;
💚&quot;Wha…? What does that mean? Why am I being left out…?&quot;
✨&quot;Hey guys, look over here~! There's a bully in the club!&quot;
❤️&quot;D-Don't say it like that, Akehoshi, it makes me seem bad! I just want to talk about something only adults should know! It isn't for kids to hear!&quot;
💚&quot;Mm… Sounds even more suspicious now… But whatever… I don't really wanna be involved in any problems anyway…&quot;
🎸&quot;You're feeling lonely, right? Ahaha, you really do love Buchou~♪ You can't relax if he isn't hugging you every day, huh~?&quot;
💚&quot;……&quot;
🎸(…!? He ignored me!? I was trying to crack jokes with him to lighten the mood, but it failed~!)
💚&quot;Isara-senpai seems to be someone I can have an actual conversation with, unlike you and Morisawa-senpai…&quot;
✨&quot;Whaa? Don't put me together with Chi~chan-senpai! We can talk to each other, too! Let's get along! Handshake~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh… I knew it, this guy's also the pushy type…&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai's always touchy-feely with us, so I bet he's got all kinds of germs on him…&quot;
💛&quot;Ah, no, he doesn't do that to me as much as he does to you, so I'm probably okay!&quot;
💚&quot;Why's he always so clingy with me… It's seriously a huge pain…&quot;
✨&quot;Ahaha, that's 'cause he always hugs the least energetic person he sees.&quot;
✨&quot;Hmm? Is Ryuseitai really always like that, Takamin?&quot;
💚&quot;Huh…? Yeah, basically… Morisawa-senpai would always show us what to do and guide us through practically everything… Like, it's as if he's just dragging us into whatever he's planned…&quot;
✨&quot;If you plan on learning from us, come back inside. We'd be in hot water too if you ended up collapsing. Chi~chan-senpai would get furious with me. I saw him angry like that once, and it was seriously terrifying.&quot;
💚&quot;……(stares curiously)&quot;
❤️&quot;But then, they did another check up for me and confirmed I have no symptoms of the disease whatsoever, so don't worry! I've completely recovered! Sorry for leaving you all alone!&quot;
💚&quot;No, it would've been way more bothersome if you came over while you were feeling sick…&quot;
🖤&quot;Ahhh… Morisawa-senpai didn't listen to the doctor's advice and tried to come over, and so Shinkai-senpai did whatever he could to stop him. I see. Good work, Senpai~♪&quot;
💚&quot;For real, good work… Gosh, Morisawa-senpai can be such a handful, huh…♪&quot;
💛&quot;We were told that we should do our best without relying on Taichou-dono, so I hid the fact that I was contacting him.&quot;
💚&quot;It's fine, really… Though I think I would've liked it if you told us he was doing okay… I couldn't really focus properly in practice from worry…&quot;
❤️&quot;Hoho, is that so! I was a little nervous that you might not care about me, since you have absolutely zero manner points towards me, but you do love me as a comrade, huh! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Will you shut up… It's so suffocating… I wish you didn't come back until summer was over…&quot;
❤️&quot;Actually, no—Let's do our best together, as we always do, Ryuseitai! All for one, one for all!&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, yeah… You really are feeling better… It's a relief to see you back to your usual self, alright?&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai, you've been at maximum hyper for a while now… Not only will you drag us down if your health gets bad again, but you're also annoying when you're like that, so please don't go into overdrive…&quot;
💚&quot;You'll drag us down if your health gets bad again, plus, you're annoying when you're hyper, so please don't go into overdrive…&quot;
❤️&quot;I feel like that 'annoying' bit was a bit too much! Or rather, saddening! But I'm aware! I'll never let myself get sick or collapse ever again!&quot;
💚&quot;Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori… Ughh, I'm already tired just from doing the stall…&quot;
❤️&quot;Now now, no fussing! Get yourself pumped up again, Takamine! We can't win against our opponents if you're like that!&quot;

💚&quot;Ah— Anzu-san… Are you here to look for Isara-senpai? Morisawa-senpai took him somewhere, 'cause he didn't want to talk about something where I could hear it… Sigh… I'm being left out of the group…&quot;
🎀&quot;I wonder what Morisawa-senpai wanted to talk about?&quot;
💚&quot;Mm~… If you're curious, how about going to the coffee shop? That's where they all said they'd talk… Even if he can't talk to me about it, I'm sure he'll talk to you about it, Anzu-san…&quot;
🎀&quot;I wonder what Morisawa-senpai wanted to talk about?&quot;
💚&quot;Who knows… He said it's between adults only, and that it isn't for kids to hear… I'm only one or two years apart from my seniors, so being treated as a kid is kinda just… Mm… It just doesn't feel good, y'know…?&quot;
💚&quot;Sigh… I'm being left out of the group…&quot;
🎀&quot;That's not true.&quot;
💚&quot;Um, they all left to a coffee shop without me, though…? Well, whatever… Hanging out outside of club activities with my seniors, Morisawa-senpai included, would just be a pain…&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, Anzu-san… I'm really depressed right now, so it's best if you don't talk to me… Huh? Morisawa-senpai? What about him?&quot;
🎀&quot;It's lonely without him, isn't it?&quot;
💚&quot;No, I don't really feel lonely or anything, though…? If anything, it's nice how quiet it is without him…&quot;
🎀&quot;It's lonely without Morisawa-senpai, isn't it?&quot;
💚&quot;No, I don't really feel lonely or anything, though…? If anything, it's nice how quiet it is without him… But, well, since he's not around 'cause he's sick, I am a little worried… So I do want him to recover…&quot;
🎀&quot;I heard that they didn't find any serious illness.&quot;
💚&quot;It's way less noisy without him around though, so it's fine like this, isn't it… I heard from Isara-senpai that he went to the hospital… I wish he'd get that suffocating energy of his cured as well, while he's at it…&quot;
🎀&quot;I heard they didn't find any serious illness.&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh… Morisawa-senpai got a check-up at the hospital…
They didn't find anything, but he could still catch a cold with his current state, so he's being told to rest…? Ugh… I can't imagine that guy staying still and resting…&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh… Did that guy really get sick…? He's as energetic as ever… He's been going around eating food from every stall, and playing that target shooting game… He even found a super sentai mask and got super excited over it… It's like he's a little kid…&quot;
🎀&quot;You seem happy.&quot;
💚&quot;I don't wanna be rude to a senior, but… Are you sure you don't have bad eyes, Anzu-san…?
I'm plummeting into depression right now… Sigh, I'm so depressed, I wanna die… But if I start sighing, Morisawa-senpai would probably tell me to cheer up…&quot;
🎀&quot;You seem happy.&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh… That's probably 'cause I got the plushie Morisawa-senpai won from the target shooting game… Heheh, its face is so odd, you can't even tell whether it's a bear or a dog… It's suuuper cute…♪
Morisawa-senpai does some nice things sometimes, huh…♪&quot;

💚&quot;Sengoku-kun? Why'd you stop walking all of a sudden?&quot;
💛&quot;Ahh, I saw a person who looked like Taichou-dono enter the toy store over there…&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh, what's he doing in a place like that…?&quot;
💛&quot;Well, it is a toy shop, so Taichou-dono must have gone in to buy some? Nonetheless, I shall go and greet him~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhh… You don't have to do that… I don't wanna be near him as much as I can during summer… It's already suffocating and tiring as it is…&quot;
💛&quot;Taichou-dono is speaking to the shop clerk about hero figurines. He seems to be enjoying himself, so I might interrupt his conversation if I greet him…?&quot;
💚&quot;H-He's so embarrassing… I don't want anyone to think we know each other, so I'm leaving now before he notices me…&quot;
💚&quot;No no, there's nothing like that here… The thought of Morisawa-senpai spotting me freaks me out, so I'd rather take the long way home than deal with that… That's all… C'mon, don't stand around… He may notice us if we're not quick enough… I really don't want that…&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? Ah! That's Takamine over there! And Sengoku! Fuhahaha, fancy meeting you two here! ♪&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh, as soon as I said that…… No, you're mistaking me for someone else… I don't know you…&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh!? Why are you saying that!? Did you forget all about me during our break!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh!? Why are you saying that!? Did you forget all about me during our break!? Alright! Then I'll just have to make you remember! I'm Morisawa Chiaki! I'm in the same Basketball Club as you! I go by Red in Ryuseitai, and you—&quot;
💚&quot;You're way too loud! Ahhh, jeez!&quot;
💚&quot;You're way too loud! Ahhh, jeez! Everyone's looking at us wondering what the heck's going on now…!! I take back what I said, okay… so please don't do anything that'll attract attention…&quot;
❤️&quot;Okay. I'm glad to know that you haven't forgotten me!&quot;
💚&quot;So you're a regular of that shop… I'm gonna stay away from it as much as I can…&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! ☆ Then I'll come over to hang out in your home once I'm done visiting the shop!&quot;
💚&quot;That just sounds like harassment to me, 'kay…?&quot;
❤️&quot;C'mon, c'mon! No need to hold back! Come and take a good, close look…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Um, I'm not really interested…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, don't be like that! I'm sure you two will learn the beauty of Sentai figurines after a thorough look at my buddy!&quot;
💚&quot;Why're you even carrying that around with you…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Heheh~ See, Mikejima-san and I were having a buddy discussion, and it brought back so many memories!&quot;
💛&quot;A buddy discussion… That sounds quite interesting.&quot;
💚&quot;Wait, no… Sengoku-kun, don't get yourself into this convo…&quot;
💚&quot;Wait, no… Sengoku-kun, don't get yourself into this convo…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh!? Are you interested, Sengoku!? Great, that's wonderful! Tell me more! What would you say is your buddy?&quot;
💚&quot;Ughhh… you see? Now this whole thing's turned into a huge bother…&quot;
💛&quot;I feel that part of you is slightly similar to Taichou-dono, Midori-kun.&quot;
💚&quot;Wha… I'm not letting you get away with saying that… Don't put me in the same boat as him…&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhahaha, how harsh! I can feel hurt too, y'know! I'd rather you choose your wording more carefully!&quot;
❤️&quot;If I was asked to choose between all of my sentai figurines, I'd be at a loss! You too, Takamine—Your buddy isn't only Captain Kidoairaku, right?&quot;
💚&quot;Of course not! I love all mascot characters…☆&quot;
❤️&quot;See, even Takamine can't choose only one.&quot;
💚&quot;And why am I being dragged along with this, anyway…? Ughhh… I didn't have any greengrocer work for once, so I just wanted to rest todayyyyy…&quot;
❤️&quot;Now, now! You gain more from hanging out with friends than lounging about at home, don't you?&quot;
❤️&quot;Now, now! You gain more from hanging out with friends than lounging about at home, don't you?&quot;
💚&quot;That may be true for you, but to me, lazing about at home is way worth my time… Ahh, dammit…! You just had to mention you were bored…!&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? You're gonna keep going…? I'm feeling thirsty, so I wanna go home…&quot;
❤️&quot;You're thirsty? Then we'll buy juice at the vending machine! It'll be my treat! ☆&quot;

🎸&quot;What're you doing here during winter break? The basketball club isn't practicing today, right?
💚&quot;Ahh yeah, I heard that… Morisawa-senpai said to take it easy going into the new year holidays, or something like that…&quot;
🎸&quot;His own brakes are completely broken, but he gives everyone else a chance to take a break, yeah?&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah… He's always prioritizing others over himself…&quot;
💚&quot;All of us in Ryuseitai came to back you up in SS, and… The moment Trickstar were announced as the winners, Morisawa-senpai let out a weird, seal-like noise…&quot;
🎸&quot;Yo, you 'kind and strong guy'~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't… Morisawa-senpai may say that to me often, but I don't really feel like it suits me…&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh… Morisawa-senpai's the same way, he pushed a huge load of Tokusatsu Blu-rays and their extra content stuff on me… It kinda irritates me that he's prepared things for me to kill time with, and I hate how it feels like homework I have to turn in…&quot;
💚&quot;But even if they have heroes, Morisawa-senpai seems to prefer Japanese tokusatsu, so I'm not sure how he'd feel about American comics…?&quot;
🎸&quot;Ahaha. That sounds exactly like you, Takamine; maybe you were born to be a modern-day hero ♪&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't, that sounds like something Morisawa-senpai would say… Though it's kinda frustrating that I can't really argue against it, either…&quot;

❤️&quot;What, really!? Even though you said you weren't good with Valentine's Day, you got something for us…!? I'm so happy! ☆&quot;

❤️&quot;Of course I'll take it!
…Oh!? Everyone, look! My cookie is in the shape of a hero! It'd be such a waste to eat this~! Can't I preserve it in resin instead!?&quot;
💚&quot;Hah…? If that's all you're gonna say, then you'll just have to hand it back to me, 'kay…?&quot;

Meteor Impact

❤️&quot;You've all done an excellent job today!
Let me embrace each and every one of you as a reward for all your hard work…! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, I'll pass.&quot;
💚&quot;(whispering) Uh? I'm pretty sure he's always been like that.
Wait, why're you even asking me… I'm honestly so exhausted, I can't even use my brain… Shinkai-senpai has been with Morisawa-senpai longer than me, hasn't he… You should ask him…&quot;
💙&quot;you really are similar to how chiaki used to be.&quot;
💚&quot;I get that often for some reason… Honestly, I don't like being told that, and it only confuses me… I mean, we're nothing alike, like, aren't we complete opposites…? Which part of us is even alike…?&quot;
❤️&quot;There's no way anyone out there would accidentally join the idol course, after all.&quot;
💚&quot;All that meteorite stuff, and how Morisawa-senpai apparently mega-exploded when he was in a pinch, and revived himself within the flames… It all sounded like a lie to me from the start…&quot;
💙&quot;i was not lying~ that is chiaki's finishing move: 'super phoenix explosion'~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Well, I'm sure that part was nonsense, but… I get the part where he struggled through a lot…&quot;

Morning Practice
(16, complete)
❤️&quot;(Breathe in, breathe out)… (Breathe in, breathe out)…♪ Mhm, that's Takamine's house over there! ☆ My sixth sense tells me so…!&quot;
❤️&quot;I can see the signboard labeled 'Takamine Greengrocer' up there. The store still isn't open so early in the morning, but there is no doubt it's his house.&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine has what it takes as long as he tries, but he still doesn't have much confidence in himself… He doesn't have the motivation, either, and immediately says negative things like, 'Can I go home now…?' or 'I'm so depressed, I wanna die…'&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine only recently enlisted in Ryuseitai, so he's surely still wobbly on his feet. In order to deepen our bonds, first comes special training, then special training, and then even more special training…☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine always has a new excuse for not showing up to morning practice, like oversleeping or a stomachache…
So this is where I, the leader of Ryuseitai and captain of the Basketball Club, must come and pick him up myself! Mhm! That's what it means to be an upperclassman! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine~! We're going to do morning training! This isn't the time to be sleeping! Good mooorning~!&quot;
💚&quot;(yawns)… What's with the ruckus so early in the morning…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh! Takamine! You got up early today, huh!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine! It's morning practice, let's go! ♪&quot;
💚&quot;Morning practice… Ughh, just the thought depresses me…&quot;
❤️&quot;What's wrong, Takamine! Cheer up, Takamine…☆&quot;
💚&quot;It's depressing enough to have morning practice, I don't need Morisawa-senpai's loud voice to depress me further…&quot;
💚&quot;I mean, I only ended up in the Basketball Club 'cause you scouted me, and it was too much of a pain to refuse… Then before I knew it, I got roped into joining Ryuseitai, too… I'm so depressed…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine! Did you forget that it's called 'enlisting,' not 'joining'?&quot;
❤️&quot;The red flame is the mark of justice! The sun of life, burning bright red…! Ryusei Red! Morisawa Chiaki…!
Alright, Takamine, you're up next!&quot;
💚&quot;No thanks…&quot;
❤️&quot;Wha…! A rebellious phase? Are you in a rebellious phase, Takamine!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Alright, Takamine, you're up next!&quot;
💚&quot;No thanks…&quot;
❤️&quot;Wha…! A rebellious phase? Are you in a rebellious phase, Takamine!?&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't shake me around by the shoulders… Ughh, I'm feeling dizzy…&quot;
💚&quot;Should we really be sticking around here…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, you're right! Thankfully you're in the mood to practice now, so I will refrain from continuing our introductions!&quot;
💚&quot;No, I'm just glad I don't have to say my catchphrase here—I don't actually have any will to practice…&quot;
❤️&quot;C'mon, Takamine! We can't keep everybody waiting! Let's dash straight away! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Alright, I get it, so quit pulling me by the hand, please…&quot;
💚&quot;Did I say something upsetting…? Uwaah, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!! I won't have the will to live if you hate me, Transfer student-san…&quot;
❤️&quot;Mmrgh, Takamine seems pretty attached to the transfer student, huh…?&quot;
💚(What do I do… Morisawa-senpai told me to team up with Shinkai-senpai, but I don't even know what to talk to him about… Morisawa-senpai said that I could get along with him, but I don't see how…?)
💚(I don't really know Shinkai-senpai well either, so I dunno what Morisawa-senpai's expecting from me by thinking I can get by just fine…)
💚(If Shinkai-senpai's capable of seeing the supernatural, then I seriously don't wanna get involved… I gotta tell Morisawa-senpai, so he can team me up with someone else…)

💚&quot;If Shinkai-senpai's version is okay, then can I also skip out on saying that cringey thing Morisawa-senpai came up with…?&quot;
❤️&quot;No, you have to make sure that you say it properly. Introducing oneself is crucial, Takamine.&quot;
❤️&quot;No, you have to make sure that you say it properly. Introducing oneself is crucial, Takamine. You only feel embarrassed because you keep convincing yourself that it's embarrassing.&quot;
💚&quot;I just can't stand to do something embarrassing in the first place…&quot;

Hero Game

❤️&quot;Takamine! Nagumo! We're going to play superheroes together for today! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Hah…? Where did this come from…? Are you stupid…?&quot;
❤️&quot;How harsh! I had never once intended for Ryuseitai to simply be about 'playing around,' y'know…? And so, in other words — we are going to play superheroes in order to become true heroes!&quot;
💚&quot;Umm…? I don't get what he's trying to say…? Do you understand, Nagumo-kun…?&quot;
💚&quot;I know I'm the last person to say this, but weren't we supposed to be aiming to be idols, not heroes…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Let's aim to be heroes, as well! Aren't you a boy, Takamine!? You should grasp onto everything you've ever wanted with your very own hands!&quot;
❤️&quot;Get yourself into the spirit like THIIIIS, and embrace everything whole! Fuhahaha! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Could you please try to make sense when you talk…? Ughh… This is such a paaain… Why do I have to play around as a hero when I'm in high school…&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh… This is such a paaain… Why do I have to play around as a hero when I'm in high school…&quot;
❤️&quot;Heh~♪ You've no time to grumble, Takamine! In tokusatsu, the enemy would wait for the hero to finish transforming, but in the real world, a villain would never show such mercy!&quot;
💚&quot;Hold on, did you seriously just call this 'idiotic' by yourself… If you know how stupid this all is, then can we not do it…? I don't wanna waste my energy over something so pointless… I wanna die…&quot;
💚&quot;I don't wanna waste my energy over something so pointless… I wanna die…&quot;
❤️&quot;Come on now, Takamine, what are you spacing out for!? Stand up, hero! For the sake of mankind's freedom! For the sake of the Earth's future…! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;I don't get their set-up at all… A ninja polluting the ocean…? They're just weirdos doing random stuff at this point…&quot;
❤️&quot;Either way, it's still a hindrance to the people! We have to stop them! It's time to fight, Takamine!&quot;
❤️&quot;I'll show you how to do it, so watch closely! Transform…! ☆ Hmhmhm~hmhm~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Oh, so you just change normally…?&quot;
❤️&quot;No peeking, Takamine! That's lewd!&quot;
❤️&quot;The red flame is the mark of justice! The sun of life, burning bright red! Ryusei Red, Morisawa Chiaki…☆&quot;
💚&quot;I just realized this, but you expose your real name just fine, huh… Aren't heroes supposed to keep their identity a secret…? Well, not that I care much…&quot;
❤️&quot;C'mon, Takamine, Nagumo, you need to chang— I mean, transform, too! I'm at a disadvantage fighting all alone against two! Even I won't be able to do much except evade their attacks!&quot;
💚&quot;Um, I'd much rather that you don't make a mess in our classroom…&quot;
❤️&quot;Exactly! Boys love heroes! And aren't you a boy, too, Takamine!? You should have the burning spirit of a boy swirling within your heart! So come, fire it up as you please! Burn up the flame of your color…☆&quot;
💚&quot;T-Transform… One sec, I'll go change my clothes in the hallway or something…&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah—! He's trying to get away! Not on our watch! Kanata, Sengoku, block his escape!&quot;

💚&quot;Shh, shhh…! Please, please don't speak so loudly…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Heeey, Takamine! Where did you go~! Come on out wherever you are~!&quot;
💚&quot;Eeek!? He's already here…!? N-Neither of you tell him I'm here, please…! I'm begging you…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine! There you are! Let's go play basketball and shed the sweat of youth once more…☆ Wait, huh? Umm, you two are in Ra*bits, right? Is it just the two of you here?&quot;
🎭&quot;Umm, are you looking for Takamine? He was here a moment ago, but left 'cause he had something to do.&quot;
❤️&quot;Mmm, so I missed him by a second. Alright, thank you for the information!
Takamine~! I'm going to make sure I find you no matter where you go! Fuhaaahahaha!! ☆&quot;
☕&quot;… Takamine-kun, Morisawa-senpai left. You can come out now.&quot;
💚&quot;T-Thank you… He's extremely insistent… I'm so grateful that you managed to make him go away…&quot;
🎭&quot;That guy's a third year, right? Is he chasing after you 'cause you messed up somehow?&quot;
💚&quot;No, he just comes over to pick me up from class every time we have club practice, and it's super annoying… so I had to run away…&quot;
💚&quot;Ughhh, it's already bad enough that we're in the same unit together—why does he have to pester me when it comes to the club, too… so depressing…&quot;
☕&quot;Umm, I think you should go to your club, though… Didn't you join it because you like basketball?&quot;
💚&quot;Not at all… I was just invited by Morisawa-senpai, and had no choice but to join… I don't actually have any drive to play…&quot;
💚&quot;Sigh, I'm so jealous… Our team captain is like that, so… I just feel suffocated and annoyed and frustrated…&quot;
💚&quot;Oh, what… You may be complaining, but you're also enjoying your club in the end…
I'm not enjoying it at all… Not my club, nor my unit, nor my school life… I'm going through the gloomiest youth…&quot;
💚&quot;Ummm… I'm new to basketball… So I'm always just standing there, without a single clue on what I'm supposed to do…
That's when Morisawa-senpai tells me to go for the shot… I just throw it without thought, and it doesn't get anywhere near the goal, as you'd expect…&quot;
💚&quot;But he still praises me for trying… Telling me that I'll be able to score next time, to practice more and go for it again…
I get annoyed by his blabbering… so there was once a time when I tried shaking him off by throwing the ball randomly, and managed to score a goal…&quot;
💚&quot;That moment felt so exhilarating that… I might have found basketball fun to play…?&quot;
❤️&quot;I see, I see! You really were having fun with us, then!&quot;
💚&quot;Eep—M-Morisawa-senpai? W-Why're you here…!?&quot;
❤️&quot;A hero will always come rushing to the person who calls for him! ☆
… That was only a joke—I just couldn't find you no matter where I looked, so I tried going back to places I've checked before. Then I heard your voice from your class, and came rushing before I knew it!&quot;
❤️&quot;I see now, so you've finally realized the joy of basketball, Takamine. I'm so happy~ Today will be a basketball day to commemorate! ☆ Now then, let's head off! Let's enjoy a sparkling youth together! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Now, let's head off to enjoy a sparkling youth together! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Eeek—Stop, don't grab the back of my collar~! S-S-Save me, you twooo…!&quot;
☕&quot;Please do your best, Takamine-kun!&quot;
🎭&quot;Break a leg, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;Dammit—Don't just stand there…! I wish I never said anything…!!&quot;

❤️&quot;Hold it right there! I never once said that we're calling it a day, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;But I don't feel like we'd get anything out of studying with Morisawa-senpai…? Like, can he even stay quiet while studying…?&quot;
💙&quot;chiaki may not seem like it, but he is actually an honor student~♪&quot;
❤️&quot;In fact, before we became five members in Ryuseitai, all I ever really did was study and practice, y'know? That's how I got so good at studying! Fuhahahaha! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ehh…? I'm shocked to hear that a blockhead like him can actually study well…&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhaha! If it frustrates you that much, then just work harder on your own studies, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;No, I'm not frustrated or anything… Sigh… Fine, I just gotta do it, right…&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep! I admire your earnest spirit, Takamine!&quot;
💙&quot;chiaki is good at accommodating others, isn't he~?&quot;
💚&quot;If only he could do that a little more with me, too… Not everyone can handle suffocating people…&quot;
💚&quot;I hate to admit it, but Morisawa-senpai's insanely good at teaching…&quot;
❤️&quot;We can't? We really can't!?&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, no, I don't wanna study with Morisawa-senpai every day, either…&quot;

Midori with Chiaki
❤️&quot;Hold it, Takamine! You shouldn't skip! I overheard what you said just now, and as your club captain I'm obligated to advise you to do otherwise!&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh… The most bothersome guy just had to hear me talking to myself… This is so depressing, I wanna die…&quot;
❤️&quot;If you have no motivation, then you just need to find some! I'll do whatever it takes to flow motivation back into you, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;Don't just blabber anything out of your mouth… If I could just 'find some,' then I wouldn't be suffering this much…&quot;
❤️&quot;There's plenty of ways to feel motivated, y'know? Like, getting yourself hyped up with adrenaline…&quot;
💚&quot;Adrenaline…? How would I go about doing that…?&quot;
❤️&quot;One way would be to put yourself in a life-threatening situation, but we can't conduct anything dangerous, so…&quot;
❤️&quot;An easier, faster way to feel motivated would be to work out! And so, without further ado, let's head to the gym and play basketball!&quot;
💚&quot;…? I can't keep up with you… Aren't you just saying something extremely dumb…?&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, I can't take it anymore… Everything is such a damn pain… Can someone please talk some sense into this guy…&quot;
Chiaki with Midori
❤️&quot;Takamine-kun, let's go to the club!&quot;
💚&quot;Huh…? Um, sorry, may I ask who you are…?&quot;
❤️&quot;What!? Did you forget who I am, Takamine!? I'm the burning heart Morisawa Chiaki! I'm Ryuseitai's leader, and the captain of the Basketball Club! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ah—So it really was Morisawa-senpai… Ughh~ It's all 'cause you called me by 'Takamine-kun' out of nowhere… It's kinda creepy… Like, what happened to you…? Did you hit your head or something…?&quot;
💚&quot;What happened to you…? Did you hit your head or something…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Heh, you always say how you hate suffocating things! So I thought you may feel otherwise if I tried to be invigorating instead! And so! Takamine-kun! Let's go to the club! Let's shed the sweat of youth…☆&quot;
❤️&quot;And so! Takamine-kun! Let's go to the club! Let's shed the sweat of youth…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh… You're still coming right up into my personal space, so nothing's actually changed, y'know…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh!? It didn't work!? Mmm~, it's hard for me to be the invigorating type!&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh… You're still coming right up into my personal space, so nothing's actually changed, y'know…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh!? It didn't work!? Mmm~, it's hard for me to be the invigorating type! Nevertheless! We've got Basketball Club activities today, so come join us, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh~… You'll drag me along with you even if I say it's a pain, won't you…? Meh, fine… I don't have any work at my family's greengrocer today, and I have the time to spare…&quot;
❤️&quot;Ohh!? Really!? I'm so happy to hear that, Takamine~♪&quot;
Shinobu with Midori
💚&quot;I was told we'd have practice in the basketball court today, so I begrudgingly headed over there… Then Morisawa-senpai apparently shot the ball outside the court… Jeez, we're not playing soccer here…&quot;
Subaru with Midori
💚&quot;Akehoshi-senpai, please don't hug me… Ughh, you're as clingy as Morisawa-senpai…&quot;

Birthday
(12, complete)
💚&quot;Erm, Morisawa-senpai… Happy birthday… Heheh, isn't it so cute…? Mhm, I'm talking about the mascot pin I clipped on you…♪
Umm… Why do you look so happy? I wasn't complimenting you, y'know…?&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh, I should've never said 'cute'… Actually, I shouldn't have given you that pin in the first place… Could you return it? Immediately, please… Um, no, don't refuse my request so desperately…&quot;
💚&quot;Huh!? It's my birthday present to you…? That wasn't why I gave it to you, though…?
Ahh, dammit, this is so annoying… Fine, whatever. Feel free to make it your birthday present… So please just leave me alone already…&quot;
❤️&quot;Today is your birthday, Takamine! Happy birthday, Takamine…! ☆ ……Hmm? No response? I don't need one! I'm waiting with my arms wide open, so leap into my arms anytime!
'Why'? …Well, isn't it more strange not to hug someone on the annual day of something this special?&quot;
❤️&quot;I had a passionate embrace with Nagumo and Sengoku on their birthdays, so there's no way I wouldn't do the same with you! ♪ And so, without further ado! Come over, Takamine! If you won't, I'll do it myself~ Fuhahahahaha!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Hm? Me…? I was asleep, but then Morisawa-senpai suddenly invaded my home… Then he called out to me saying, 'I took your favorite cushion as hostage! If you're a hero, then come and save it!'&quot;
💚&quot;I don't remember ever becoming a hero or anything… Actually, I can't believe he'd do something like kidnapping… When he's the one who keeps calling himself a hero… Hm? Why're you giggling? Did I say something weird?&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai ruined one of my other favorite cushions before, too. I'll never forgive him…! I have to protect my cushion this time…!!&quot;
💚&quot;You said you'd take me to where Morisawa-senpai is, so I followed you, but… All of a sudden I have to wear this, too… Just what is—Wait, now that I think about it, haven't I seen this sash before…? Is it for a birthday party… Like, mine…?&quot;
💚&quot;Is that so… Suddenly I feel a chill down my—Ggh!? Morisawa-senpai is looking at me with the biggest grin on his face… Anzu-san, I'm sorry, but I suddenly remembered something I gotta do, so can I go home…?&quot;
💚&quot;Hm? What did I get from Morisawa-senpai? …He gave me a load of tokusatsu DVDs and said, 'Do you like it!?'
…Why would he think I'd like this…?&quot;
❤️&quot;I made my sash by myself. Earlier, when I was telling Takamine about my birthday, it fell off of me from moving around too roughly… He was really shocked, saying 'What are you doing!?'
Then he clipped the sash back on for me with a mascot character pin! Isn't that so touching?&quot;

💚&quot;Ahhh… Why does Morisawa-senpai make me join morning practice, too…? I seriously wanted to sleep some more…&quot;
💚&quot;I hate it when I have unit practice in the morning… Morisawa-senpai isn't even here yet, and I can already hear his laughter ringing in my ears…&quot;
💚&quot;I'm in the same unit and club as Morisawa-senpai, and man, he's always so energetic, isn't he…&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai always comes over to pick me up for club practice… He comes into my classroom and yells for me, and it's just so embarrassing…&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai told me to watch the new Hero Sentai show… Sighh… There's no way I could wake up early on a Sunday for that…&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! ☆ Unit practice really just doesn't feel complete unless we have everyone around! Takamine gladly came over for practice today, as well!&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! ☆ Oh! I should be more quiet at night, or Takamine and Nagumo will scold me again!&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine always tries to skip morning practice, so I often go and pick him up. This is just one of the many responsibilities a senior has to take!&quot;
❤️&quot;We have club practice now, but Takamine still hasn't shown up. Very well then! I'll just have to go and pick him up from class! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! I got a watermelon from Takamine! Now we can do a watermelon splitting contest! ☆&quot;
🎸&quot;Ahaha, looks like Buchou went over to Takamine's house again to wake him up. He looks even more annoyed than usual while preparing for our morning practice…&quot;

💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai, why do you always come over to my side during practice…? It's exhausting…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh!? You're exhausted!? I'm worried now! I'll have to watch you from close by in case you need rescuing…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Uwaaaa~! The new drink they're selling comes with a limited mascot character bonus! How many should I buy…!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hmm? You want more than one? Then I'll also buy a drink and give you the mascot as a bonus! ♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, shoot… I messed up and grazed my arm… Oh well, it's only a light scratch, so it should heal in no time!&quot;
💚&quot;It may only be a 'scratch' for you, but it hurts just looking at it… I'll give you this mascot character band-aid as a special exception, so please use it…&quot;
❤️&quot;T-Takamine!? I was only trying to greet you with a hug—why did you bring out an eggplant!?&quot;
💚&quot;Come any closer, and I'll shove this eggplant straight inside your pocket… I'm dead serious…&quot;
💚&quot;What do you want, Morisawa-senpai…? If you've got nothing for me, I'm leaving…&quot;
❤️&quot;Wait, wait, Takamine! You're already out the door before giving me a chance to tell you!&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine, calling for me…!? This is worthy of a celebration! ♪&quot;
💚&quot;…Crap, I accidentally called Morisawa-senpai over… I wanna die…&quot;
🌻&quot;Midori-kun, you look down in the dumps today, don'tcha? I'm gonna tease ya if you keep this up~ pokepoke~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh, I'm feeling depressed 'cause Morisawa-senpai's gonna come over to pick me up as soon as class is over… You won't get a reaction out of me…&quot;
💚&quot;I thought I could have a peace of mind if I turned Morisawa-senpai into some sort of mascot, but every design ends up looking so overbearing…&quot;
✨&quot;Ahaha! That's just the norm for him! You're honestly better off not trying~&quot;
💚&quot;Why do I have so many solo parts in this song when I don't even wanna stand out… I feel like Morisawa-senpai's got something against me…&quot;
🖤&quot;Uumyu, you've got some tricky parts… But I'm sure Taichou gave 'em to you 'cuz he knew you'd manage it just fine!&quot;
🖤&quot;Gimme an energetic response, Midori-kun!&quot;
💚&quot;Um, aren't you becoming a little too similar to Morisawa-senpai lately, Tetora-kun?&quot;
❤️&quot;Ohhh!? I don't see Takamine at the club yet. Very well then, I'll go and pick him up…☆&quot;
✨&quot;I feel like it's partly your fault why he barely comes over… But eh, I doubt pointing that out would change anything.&quot;
🎸&quot;Buchou, be more careful with how you act, okay~? Subaru's one thing, but now Takamine's been complaining to me, too.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ohh, Takamine is comfortable complaining when it's you, huh!? That makes me feel a little lonely, but it's still great news! I'm counting on you, Isara!&quot;
🖤&quot;Woah, it's rare for you to be the first one to practice, Shinkai-senpai! Where's the rest of us?&quot;
💙&quot;chiaki is picking up midori, and shinobu has a meeting with the broadcast committee. let's talk together for now~&quot;

💚&quot;Why does Morisawa-senpai hug me every single chance he gets…? It's so annoying…&quot;
💚&quot;It's so hot… The sun's insanely suffocating…… It's starting to look like Morisawa-senpai now… This is so depressing…&quot;
💚&quot;Uu… Morisawa-senpai just had to grab me when he got pulled into the fountain, so I ended up getting dragged into the mess… this is so depressing…&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai's been picking up a basket of mushrooms, but they're all poisonous, so please throw them out later.&quot;
💚&quot;It feels like it'd feel warm being nearby Morisawa-senpai, or at least, for some reason that's how it looks during winter…&quot;
❤️&quot;This morning, I picked Takamine up from his home, and all he could say was 'I'm so depressed' over and over again! Ha ha ha!! ☆ He's such a handful!&quot;
❤️&quot;I collected some red mushrooms, but Takamine threw them all away because they're poisonous… Ghhh! Alas, it was not meant to be, Mushroom Red!&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine looked at the sun and said, 'The burning bright red sun of life should just perish,' but I'll never perish!&quot;

❤️&quot;What's up, Takamine! Does your stomach hurt!? Exercise is the perfect medicine for the stomach! Let's do hindu squats together! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Shut up.  …Please look at this for a moment, Morisawa-senpai.&quot;
❤️&quot;Did you just casually tell me to shut up!? With a low voice, too! Are you in your rebellious phase, Takamine~!? Is my love not reaching you!?&quot;
💚&quot;I was always acting 'rebellious' towards you, though…&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? Uhh… But is that okay for you? You're seeing me off for some reason, but don't you have loads of work to do for the rest of the day?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah… You're right. You've grown so splendidly, Takamine. I'm so proud of you~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Do not pat my head.&quot;
💚&quot;… Alright, I gotta hurry, so I'll be leaving now. I'll keep you updated.&quot;
❤️&quot;Got it. Be careful, Takamine—I have a bad feeling about this.&quot;
🖤&quot;You were happy about possibly meeting Morisawa-senpai, since he's doing a drama shoot in the same place, weren't you?&quot;
💚&quot;I was not!&quot;
💚&quot;We were just talking on HoldHands and that idiot was all giddy like, 'then I'll come see you, Takamine! ☆', and then had to go and find a way to come over and greet me!&quot;
🖤&quot;Ahh, so you did get to see him. Good, good, was he doing well?&quot;
💚&quot;Heh, let's see if you can get through my Takamine Barricade technique, a skill I learned from the now-deceased Morisawa-senpai.&quot;
💛&quot;No, no! You keep casually saying he's dead lately, but he'll be here as soon as he finishes his task, so please don't make our audience worry!&quot;

💚&quot;It's like I can barely get my point across with her… It really makes you think of a certain someone—&quot;
🖤&quot;…But if Morisawa-senpai was here, I bet he'd solve all our problems perfectly, no matter what they may be.&quot;
💚&quot;Uh, nobody mentioned that guy, though…?&quot;
💚&quot;Besides, what's dead is dead; we have to overcome our hardships on our own now.&quot;
💛&quot;Hold on a moment! He isn't actually dead, y'know…!?&quot;
💚&quot;As a Ryuseitai member, he is… He's been doing way more work outside of the unit than I have…&quot;
💚&quot;Hmph… All his &quot;I love you&quot;'s weren't true after all; he's all talk and no action…&quot;
💚&quot;Are we really sure Morisawa-senpai and Shinkai-senpai are gonna stick around…? Or did they seriously lose all interest in being part of Ryuseitai…&quot;
💚&quot;They have no idea how much Morisawa-senpai ran himself ragged with preparations and begging the higher-ups for permission, all for the sake of a festival that spanned only a moment in our lives.&quot;
❤️&quot;GOOOOOD WORK EVERYONE!&quot;
💚&quot;Eep!? What the—Hey, doesn't that stupidly loud voice sound way too familiar…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh!? You guuuys…!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh, he just had to notice us.&quot;
❤️&quot;Are you all feeling well? Sleeping well? Eating well? Keeping the flame of justice burning within your hearts well…!?&quot;
💚&quot;Eugh…&quot;
💛&quot;'Eugh,' indeed… There's no way anyone could handle the embarrassment of someone loudly calling out to them from across the street…&quot;
❤️&quot;You guuuys~! What're you talking about!? Yell back your responses so I can hear you! Let me in your conversations! Share with me your experiences!&quot;
💚&quot;Holy crap… It's been so long that I'd almost forgotten just how annoyingly loud he is… Why does he need to yell so much…?&quot;
💚&quot;Can't I just head home first and let you guys deal with that mess of a guy…?&quot;
💛&quot;Ahaha, why do you want to head home? It's rare that we get to talk to him these days; you should join in, too!&quot;
💚&quot;…He's gone. What was that about…? He was acting kinda weird.&quot;
💚&quot;…Hey, you. Don't you dare think about slipping out of here all proud and happy—You're on stage right now, so please make sure to do what you're supposed to do.&quot;
❤️&quot;T-Takamine? What's wrong, you seem kind of angry…? You shouldn't kick your senior's butt, y'know?&quot;
💚&quot;So sorry about that. It was entirely an accident, my legs are just long.&quot;
💙&quot;fufu, it is because you are always late to the rescue, chiaki. midori and i start getting irritated the more we wait for you. after all, we knew for a fact that you would come over one way or another…&quot;
💙&quot;this performance requires all five of us for it to glow best, so you will not be helping anyone by stepping back, chiaki.&quot;
💚&quot;Exactly. Just having these M and N tags doesn't change a thing about us…&quot;
💚&quot;You're still a hero, and a member of Ryuseitai at that, aren't you? So please don't go around showing your uncool side. It's gonna throw us off if you act so lame… Since you're still part of Ryuseitai, just like us.

Dollhouse

💚(Ahh, man… I used to be able to ignore every bothersome thing without a second thought… But thanks to a certain someone, I now have something like a hero's voice inside me, constantly poking me to not be that way…)
💚(I feel like his overbearing blood is consuming my body, and it makes me wanna die… It'd be a different story if it's just learning from someone, but this is—… I really just don't wanna be infected by that guy of all people.)
💚(But I'm sure if Morisawa-senpai were here, he'd immediately help out without a second thought…)
💚(I think they'll be able to understand what's going on if I send a message saying, 'Kagehira-senpai is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse'… Now it's just deciding who to ask…
Ughh… A certain overbearing face keeps popping up… Go away.)
💚&quot;Ahh, dammit—Why does he come to mind when I'm in trouble… Is it 'cause he's a hero? (mumble, mumble)&quot;
🍬&quot;M-Midori-kun? Why're ya mumblin' ta yerself while typing…? Yer face's scarin' me…&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't mind me. I just felt a rush of irritation well up inside me…&quot;
💚&quot;But I couldn't type the whole thing… Will he understand…? Actually, I wouldn't mind if he comes over 'cause of the message cutting off so strangely…&quot;
💚(Please, notice our SOS… I don't have that much hope in you, but I at least know you're a hero who'll come to the rescue, Morisawa-senpai…)
💚&quot;He's still not here…!&quot;
💚&quot;Mmm? I think this is that giant robot we had in front of the ES building for an event a while back… I think it's the chest piece?
Morisawa-senpai went nuts over it and sent me a whole bunch of photos, so I sorta remember it…&quot;
💚&quot;Oh yeah, hasn't enough time passed since I sent that message? I wish he'd notice the SOS and come rescue us already…&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh… Weren't you supposed to be a hero to anyone in need…? You always stick your nose in my business even when I say no, so what gives…?
I know there's that whole 'a hero always arrives in the nick of time' saying, but can you not do that this time…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm… Where on earth is Takamine? It's already time for practice… I think his phone is dead because I can't call him, either.&quot;
❤️(I tried asking around, and it sounded like he was delivering vegetables early in the morning… The manager of Cinnamon said that he finished his delivery over there, so I don't think he's still delivering anything…)
❤️(I accidentally mentioned that I couldn't find Takamine anywhere and made the manager worried… I feel bad. I'll have to let them know when I find Takamine that everything's all right.)
❤️&quot;On the other hand, Takamine sure is hardworking! He's been properly going to school, doing his jobs, and even helping out his family's greengrocer!&quot;
❤️&quot;The manager also praised him a lot, and hearing it made me feel proud~♪
But if I said any of this to him, he might get angry at me again and tell me off for treating him like a kid… But I can't help it! I'm so happy to hear my junior getting praise and recognition!&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh? What a coincidence! I'm also looking for Takamine!&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine didn't pick up the phone when I called him because his phone died, but before that, he managed to send me this.&quot;
❤️&quot;In other words, Takamine is talking to Kagehira-kun about superhero staples, the shows that pop into your head when you think of heroes.&quot;
❤️&quot;They might be playing pretend in one right now, so Takamine wanted to message me saying he'll be late…!
But gosh, he's such a ditz—He sent me the message midway~☆&quot;
💚(Why won't you come save us…? Isn't a hero supposed to always come to the rescue whenever there's danger…?)
💚(I didn't believe that at first… But you'd always, always arrive on the scene—and you'd always, always, always, always be shouting as loud as you could…
And before I knew it, I started to think… maybe even believe, just a little, and yet—)
💚(It's not that I thought you'd never lie, but… I felt like… you wouldn't let it be a lie. I really started to feel that way.
That was enough for me to keep working as hard as I could…)
💚(So why…? Why won't you come…
… No. I'm already aware… I'm just taking it out on you.)
💚(I didn't wanna accept the truth, and it's been making my heart race like crazy…
'cause what's really making me mad… the one who's really pathetic right now is—)
💚&quot;All I ever do is whine, like I'm doing now… I even told Morisawa-senpai not to show an uncool side to us, like an arrogant idiot…
But in the end, I'm the one who's the really uncool, pathetic loser…&quot;
❤️&quot;Are Takamine and Kagehira-kun really over here…?&quot;
❤️&quot;So that means… What Takamine wanted to say was—'Kagehira-kun is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse'!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamineeeeee!!&quot;
❤️&quot;Are you alright!? Are either of you hurt anywhere!?&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? M-Morisawa-senpai…?&quot;
💚&quot;How'd you two unlock the door!? Did you have the key or something!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? Key? There wasn't a lock or anything, though?&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? B-But, we couldn't open it no matter how hard we pushed or pulled…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Umm…? It's a sliding door, y'know? Look—It opens when you slide it.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ha ha ha!! ☆ Don't be that way, Takamine! You two are safe, and that's all that matters!
Don't worry about it! We all have days when we fail—that's what makes us human! Failures are the key to success!&quot;
💚&quot;Shut up. Don't you dare say 'failure' again.&quot;
❤️&quot;If you're a boy, then leap forth with full confidence! Jump out and reach for your future, Takamine! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine! Our comrades are waiting for your return! Let's return at the speed of a shooting star!&quot;
💚&quot;……&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? No response!? What's wrong, what's up!?&quot;
💚(He's the same old overbearing Morisawa-senpai, right…?
My eyes must've tricked me for a moment. It was pretty dark in there… and out of nowhere, it suddenly got really bright… I'm sure that's the real reason why Morisawa-senpai and Aoba-senpai looked like heroes…)
💚&quot;—He'll only get more overbearing if I say that out loud, so I'll keep it to myself.&quot;
❤️&quot;Did you say something, Takamine?&quot;
💚&quot;Nope. Yeah, you're right. That's enough darkness for one day. Let's go somewhere brighter.&quot;

💚&quot;You really didn't have to follow Morisawa-senpai's footsteps when it comes to that…&quot;
🎸&quot;Wha~? I'm gonna tell him to come over if you keep saying stuff like that, y'know~?&quot;
By bot owner
💚&quot;Eep—No, that's the worst idea ever…! That guy's graduated already, but he still torments me… I had a nightmare about him just the other day, y'know…!?
I even sweated through my blanket in my sleep… I really don't want him to show up anywhere outside of work…&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhhh… But now I feel like I'm being left out, and I don't like that…
And Morisawa-senpai's always been pretty secretive about the stuff that's actually important… Is it 'cause I'm not trustworthy…?&quot;
💚&quot;Ughhh… You're so overbearing, it's reminding me of Morisawa-senpai…&quot;

🌹&quot;Hmm… Would Morisawa-shi still be happy if I flicked a supplement pill towards him as a packed lunch?&quot;
☕&quot;Yes. I think he'll still be happy and say something like, 'Thank you! I was just in the mood for this!'—In fact, I heard him say this exact sentence to Takamine-kun once.&quot;
Turn of the Century Wars
(1, incomplete)
💚&quot;Work counts as school credits, so we can pass even if we aren't good at studying… But Morisawa-senpai semi-forced us to join summer classes 'cause 'A student's duty's to study! Neglecting your schoolwork would only turn you into a careless adult!'…&quot;
Comet Show
(105, incomplete)
By ENGstars translations
💚&quot;That means he's not actually asking for our opinions… Morisawa-senpai is always like this…&quot;
❤️&quot;You two over there! Stop complaining! Use that time to face your troubles! Change all of your powah into energy! Transform!&quot;
💚&quot;How energetic can you get…? So annoying…&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, that's right~ You do get weirdly excited after an all-nighter… Guess Morisawa-senpai didn't get much sleep… See, his eyes look a bit red, too…&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm too sca—I mean, I don't have much interest in movies that only feature kaijuus! So I don't really know anything about them!&quot;
💚&quot;And you still had the confidence to say that you'd show us an example…?&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh… Morisawa-senpai's appearance in that new tokusatsu show has been officially announced, so he probably started training already…&quot;
💛&quot;As always, you are extremely knowledgeable about Morisawa-dono, Midori-kun.&quot;
🖤&quot;Yeah, how come you know everything about him? Do you regularly search for 'Morisawa Chiaki' online or something?&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, I do. What's wrong with that…? I don't actually care if he's dead or alive, but I need to monitor him to see if he says anything bad about me, y'know…?&quot;
💚&quot;It's saying something if Shinobu-kun of all people felt angry. Is that guy an evil god that came down to destroy humanity or something…?&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah… They gallantly appeared before us when we were about to give up. I thought they were gonna say, 'Never give up!' or something equally hot-blooded—But they suddenly started to spill out nonsense… Saying things that were completely unreasonable and ridiculous…&quot;
💚&quot;Before that guy's graduation, he'd always pester me no matter how many times I refused him, but now I can't see him unless I go out of my way to find him…? That's so unreasonable…&quot;
💙&quot;heyy~! you guuuuys~! ehehe, i am pretending to be chiaki~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't do that… If you also start to act like him, then it's going to be utter hell… It's already bad enough that Tetora-kun is acting more and more like that guy lately…&quot;
💛&quot;Ah, is he the one who's wearing a full-body suit over there? Morisawa-dono is performing as the kaijuu role in this new show, right?&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, yeah, it does look like his movement.&quot;
🖤&quot;In what way?&quot;
💚&quot;I don't really wanna complain about this, but thanks to you two seniors, I feel like this mental cold will drag on for a bit longer…&quot;
💚&quot;Hey… Morning, I guess~…&quot;
❤️&quot;Wow, you sound like a convenience store worker who has no motivation whatsoever!&quot;
💚&quot;Sigh… Good morning… Both of you are always so energetic…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine~! You're late! I got so worried! I thought you got in an accident!&quot;
💚&quot;I'm not late, though… You two are too early. Why are you so enthusiastic, anyway…&quot;
💚&quot;(mumble) I thought this was the last day the five of us could be together, so I've been depressed about it…&quot;
❤️&quot;What's wrong!? You look down! Are you alright!? Did something bad happen!? Alrighty, I'll share a part of my po~wer with you! There, there, good boy, good boy~☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Alrighty then, I'll share a part of my po~wer with you! There, there, goood boy, good boy~☆&quot;
💚&quot;You're being annoying, so can you stop hugging me…? Also, I wanted to ask this for a long time—why do you say 'power' in a weird way…?&quot;
💙&quot;fufu, you're so close to each other~&quot;
❤️&quot;What's wrong!? You're so gloomy! But it makes me feel nostalgic to see you so gloomy! Alright, let me share my passion, my light, and my po~wer with you!&quot;
💚&quot;I'm gonna kill you if you say that 'po~wer' one more time.&quot;
❤️&quot;Why!?&quot;
💚&quot;Because it's getting on my nerves…&quot;
💚&quot;Did you forget? I'm not a morning person, so I'm always this depressed… It's not like I'm upset or anything. This is how I usually am…&quot;
❤️&quot;That's right. Are you okay lately? Are you able to wake up properly without my help? Mom's worried about you!&quot;
💚&quot;You're not my mama.&quot;
💚&quot;I've already had enough of these two ridiculous seniors—Tetora-kun, Shinobu-kun, come here already~…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Look, Takamine! Look! Sunfish! They're cute and just like you, don't you think? I mean, you can't tell if they're dead or alive…!&quot;
💚&quot;I'm actually in awe if you really think that's a compliment.&quot;
💙&quot;sunfish are high-maintenance, so we weren't sure if we should have them here.&quot;
💚&quot;Right, and in that regard, I'm also like those sunfish—is that what you wanna say, Morisawa-senpai?&quot;
❤️&quot;D-Don't treat everything as a bad comment about yourself! That's a bad habit, Takamine!&quot;
💙&quot;'tricky' and 'troublesome' are sometimes forms of compliments, too~♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Kanata! Nice follow-up! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;That doesn't cancel out what you said… Can you pay more attention to what you're saying? Though I'm also at fault for thinking everything at its worst—&quot;
❤️&quot;—It's unfortunate, though.&quot;
💚&quot;Fwuh? W-What do you mean…? I mean, it's true our achievements are pretty unfortunate compared to yours…&quot;
❤️&quot;What're you on about? I've said this many times—you're all doing incredible! You're already way better than us as idols at your age!&quot;
❤️&quot;Frankly, I did want to do something more like an idol back then. But that wish came true when you all joined us the next year, Takamine. So again, thank you for making my dream come true! Thank you all…☆&quot;
💚&quot;…Apart from that, why did you say 'unfortunate' earlier? What was 'unfortunate'?&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm, I just feel that it's unfortunate that Nagumo and Sengoku are going to be late. I was planning to talk about something serious with the five of us all together.&quot;
❤️&quot;Wait, why didn't you ask? It's important to report, contact, and communicate!&quot;
💚&quot;How can you say that when you keep carrying all the burden on yourself without telling anyone…?&quot;
💚(Because of that, I ended up with Morisawa-senpai alone… Like we're on a meaningless date in this aquarium… It's almost like I'm bonded with Morisawa-senpai by fate, and I hate it… It also just feels so lonely with everyone apart from each other…)
By bot owner
❤️&quot;Look, Takamine! They're selling plushies of some deep-sea creatures! I have no idea what they're meant to be!&quot;
❤️&quot;You love these kinds of loose-looking and shapeless creatures, right!? Alrighty then, your dad will buy it for you to commemorate us spending time together in the aquarium today!&quot;
💚&quot;You're not my papa either, 'kay?&quot;
💚&quot;You're not my papa either, 'kay?
(Actually, right now it does kinda feel like he's a dad awkwardly trying to appease his daugh—his son in order to improve their strained relationship… But it's such a fitting scenario that I don't wanna say it out loud…)&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, look over here! This one looks exactly like you! So cute~!&quot;
💚&quot;Do you seriously not have any other way to compliment people…? And for the record, being compared to some mysterious deep-sea creature doesn't make me happy at all, 'kay…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, was that a pun!? Good one, Takamine! You win first prize…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh, shut up… Man, it's been a while since we've had a back-and-forth like this.&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, I was thinking something similar just now. It's always so nice to share something in common, no matter what it is, huh? That feeling of joy gets cut in half whenever it's with you, though.&quot;
❤️&quot;Why did you have to add that!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Then who would you have instead preferred to be with right now? Nagumo? Sengoku? Or maybe Kanata? Why're you always so blunt towards just me!? Your dear ol' grandpa feels so lonely!&quot;
💚&quot;Could you at least stick to one role…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Your dear ol' grandpa feels so lonely!&quot;
💚&quot;Could you at least stick to one role…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Alright… But, as pathetic as this may sound, I don't even know what we are to you guys right now anymore.&quot;
❤️&quot;I can't seem to manage it at all. It's hard to be a kaijuu.&quot;
💚&quot;From what I saw when I was at the studio the other day, I think you managed to perform your kaijuu role pretty well. Well, not that I know enough about them to be sure of that…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, I appreciate you telling me that! You're really good at giving compliments! You're always so harsh, so a compliment from you makes me extra happy, like I really did do a good job!&quot;
💚&quot;What're you talking about…? Even I give honest compliments sometimes too, y'know…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hehe, I do have a few things I want to improve on, though. Starting with what my director pointed out: I had an overwhelming presence for a kaijuu.&quot;
💚&quot;Ahhh~… Yeah, I always think that about you, too…&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, I'm sorry for being so overbearing.&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? What's wrong? It's rare to see you make such a grim face; did a monster invade the streets or something?&quot;
💚&quot;You watch way too much tokusatsu, Senpai.&quot;
❤️(Mmm~… I have nothing to do while Takamine talks on the phone. Maybe I should check my work contacts on HoldHands while I have the time.)
❤️&quot;(But… That's exactly why this time around—For the sake of the kids who turned me, a cowardly crybaby, into a hero—)
Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, yes. I'm sorry, the call is over now. …What's with the serious face?&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm always serious! And I seriously love you!&quot;
💚&quot;Die, please. …I'm well aware how badly you wanna look cool—you're just a liar as fake as paper-mache.&quot;
💚&quot;Die, please. …I'm well aware how badly you wanna look cool—you're just a liar as fake as paper-mache.
You don't have to hide your true form from the people close to you, the same heroes as you—do you?&quot;
💚&quot;We're not in some old tokusatsu show or American comic, so why do you keep hiding your true self?
What, is your family gonna be held hostage by an evil organization if people find out your true identity? Or are you gonna get arrested for being a vigilante or something?&quot;
💚&quot;I doubt you've done anything illegal in the first place, and we've grown strong enough to protect ourselves by now.&quot;
💚&quot;Could you quit pretending not to see us for ourselves already? It pisses me off…
You keep treating us like weaklings who need to be protected, just so you can remain as the hero.&quot;
❤️&quot;T-That isn't what I—
I just don't want my place of belonging—the dream I've finally achieved—to be smashed into pieces again.&quot;
💚&quot;'Again'? I dunno what you're on about, but you really are looking down on us, aren't you…?&quot;
💚&quot;But Senpai, did you know? As the leader of Ryuseitai-N, Tetora-kun did an amazing job protecting and raising ten times the amount of pathetic juniors than you have.&quot;
💚&quot;Well, I think Tetora-kun will keep pushing forward no matter what, and work as hard as he can. So don't just give up like that; please keep supporting him in every way you can—Senpai.&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm aware. Our decision to leave Ryuseitai has to do with that, too. There are some things that are hard to do while wearing the mask of justice.&quot;
💚&quot;Huh, is that so… And here I thought you were working yourself to the bone 'cause you wanted that 'mask' so badly.&quot;
❤️&quot;………&quot;
💚&quot;I'm the worst out of the flock, so I guess that's why you kept supporting me the most, like during Repayment Festival—But Shinobu-kun and Tetora-kun both probably went through a similar life to mine; I'm sure they barely got any praise from anyone in the past.&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, really…? But I was trying my best to hug, pat and praise them for every single thing they do.&quot;
💚&quot;You're awful at it… Like, you do that to basically everyone in the same fashion, so it's hard to tell if that's real praise or not.&quot;
💚&quot;It always felt like you were just trying to praise us with something, anything, like giving candy to a kid, and it really ticked me off.&quot;
❤️&quot;I see… This is quite difficult for me. I'm not that good at communicating with people, to be honest. I was living a very lonely youth before I met you guys.&quot;
💚&quot;So that hot-blooded heroic stuff you do really was an act all along… Well, I figured it was…
It felt so fake to see you act that way. Like, I'd keep thinking there's no way a person like this actually exists in real life. You always acted as if a camera was recording you.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing… But in that sense, it's incredible how you can act so naturally all the time.&quot;
💚&quot;You say that like it's a good thing… I just find acting a pain to do… There was nothing I wanted so badly that I'd go through the effort of doing that.&quot;
💚&quot;But things are different now. I have something I want—something I wanna get no matter what it takes.&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? What would that be? Could it be my love or something!?&quot;
💚&quot;You'd push that on me even if I said I didn't want it, wouldn't you?&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh, I see. I think it's cute, though.&quot;
💚&quot;I think so, too. We agree for once, huh, Senpai?&quot;
💚&quot;As always, you're so bad at figuring things out. Lemme put it in other words—
It's kinda messy, but… To put it simply, it's our turn to shine, Senpai.&quot;
❤️&quot;It all makes sense now! I feel a weight off my back with that mystery solved.&quot;
💚&quot;What is there to even feel relieved over…? Seriously, what the hell is 'final parting memory' even supposed to mean…?&quot;
💚&quot;I don't think the kaijuu role suits you, though. —You're much more suited to be this, aren't you?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hmm, so… the outfits Anzu handed to us earlier were for the live show?&quot;
❤️&quot;Wow, she managed to stitch them up in such a short amount of time. I feel like she's becoming superhuman at this point.&quot;
💚&quot;Everyone's been getting better and stronger, you've just been pretending not to see it.&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh! How convenient! The toilet's right in front of us!&quot;
💚&quot;Okay, feel free to change first.&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? We aren't changing together? We'd get the job done faster that way, though! C'mon, all the kiddos are waiting for our rescue!&quot;
💚&quot;For some reason, I can't stomach the idea of being in a tight space with you…&quot;
❤️&quot;You can't stomach the idea!? Why do you say that, Takamine!? I'm not planning on doing anything strange! I promise!&quot;
💚&quot;Why do I get the feeling you'll break your promise in an instant…?&quot;
💚&quot;Let's not complicate this and just change after each other, 'kay? We'll be failures as heroes if we don't make it on time for an important moment.&quot;
❤️&quot;True… But am I really going as Red again? I've been telling all of you over and over again that Nagumo's the current leader of Ryuseitai…&quot;
💚&quot;Mmm~… I think it's only you tokusatsu fans who waste your time caring about that kind of thing…&quot;
💚&quot;Every last one of you are so insistent on making everything harder on yourselves with this pointless stuff—It's all so dumb.&quot;
❤️&quot;……?&quot;
💛&quot;You arrived so late! We were so worried for you!&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, sorry about that… I had an argument with Morisawa-senpai on the way here…&quot;
💛&quot;A-Again…?&quot;
🖤&quot;Yup, yup. But that said, where is Morisawa-senpai anyway…? Shouldn't he have been with you, Midori-kun?&quot;
💚&quot;Mm… There wasn't enough time to pre-record the kaijuu's part of the script, so he's improvising it live with that stupid voice you're hearing instead…&quot;
💚&quot;He looked happy when he was talking about how grateful he was for the opportunity to practice his kaijuu performance, but… I bet he'd much rather be a hero…&quot;
💚&quot;I bet he'd much rather be a hero… And let's be real, a kaijuu role of all casting choices is the last thing his fans would consider suitable for him, sooo… We need to get him out of that role already.&quot;
💚&quot;Of all people who'd nitpick, I didn't expect it to be you, Shinkai-senpai… Morisawa-senpai had to rush a script out on his way here, so you'll just have to accept the bad writing for what it is…&quot;
💚&quot;The Great Kaijuu's carrying the entirety of mankind's malice inside of it—and while Morisawa-senpai may put up a strong front and all, he's too weak and dumb to win against something that massive all on his own.
As much as it pains me, I guess we'll just have to back him up.&quot;
💚&quot;Red! You're gonna get fried if you just stand there all alone! Get your ass over here! Do we have to tell you what to do every time!?&quot;
❤️&quot;W-Why're you snapping at me, Green!? And watch your language! You should speak to your seniors politely! Promise me that, okay!?&quot;
💚&quot;Exactly. We're only two years apart, but you still act like you're sooo much more mature than us—&quot;
❤️&quot;W-Why are you guys being so harsh!? You keep firing off one remark after the other! But it's fine, I guess! It reminded me of our time during Supernova!&quot;
❤️&quot;In fact! Tokusatsu has incredible technology to make even the fakest things look super realistic!&quot;
💚&quot;Huh, that description sounds exactly like you… Ahhh, so that's why you love tokusatsu so much…&quot;
❤️&quot;H-How did you even reach that conclusion!?&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm not made of paper-mache! And even if I was, I can assure you that I've been doing my absolute best to improve and polish myself, inside and out!&quot;
💚&quot;Well, yeah, that's why you're ES's pride, and such an in-demand entertainer right now.&quot;
💚&quot;…Why…&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm?&quot;
💚&quot;Why are you, a stupidly positive person… holding back and giving up so easily on the unit that should mean so much to you?&quot;
❤️&quot;You're going to bring that up again, Takamine?&quot;
❤️&quot;Well, the truth is… Another reason we were late was because Takamine threw a tantrum.&quot;
💚&quot;Now you're calling it a tantrum… Fine, so it kinda was one, but you're just spreading misinfo and making me look bad…&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm, I'm sorry. I swear I'm not angry at you or anything.&quot;
💚&quot;Fine, sure, I did throw a tantrum. But when I couldn't move a single muscle anymore, that idiot over there gently stretched out his hand to me.&quot;
💚&quot;He started telling me, 'you don't have to force yourself,' 'you don't have to do it if you don't want to,' 'you could even run away if you like.'
'You don't have to hold yourself back, and if anybody makes a fuss, I'll protect you from it.'&quot;
💚&quot;That stupid hero over there started to say stupidly heroic stuff to me.&quot;
❤️&quot;…What else should I have done?&quot;
💚&quot;No, you can stay that way. You're just acting as the ideal hero you dreamed to be—Or well, maybe saying that is off. That's just you properly being a hero, right?&quot;
💚&quot;I'm supposed to be capable of proudly saying I'm a hero, and yet, I wasn't able to fulfill my duty as one. Even when there was someone right in front of me acting as a role model, showing me how to do it in the simplest visual possible.&quot;
🖤(Wait, no… He does actually say rude stuff to some people, like Morisawa-senpai. What's that all about anyway? Is he trying to act like a spoiled kid around him—or maybe they're messing around with each other? I mean, it sounds like it's how he expresses his love, so…?)
💚&quot;That's the kind of sneaky strategy I'm going for here… He he he~♪&quot;
💙&quot;hmm, i see. but you do not have to copy after chiaki when it comes to that.&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh!? Was I ever the type to do that sort of sneaky stuff!?&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, I learned this trick from you, Senpai.&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh!? Was I ever the type to do that sort of sneaky stuff!?&quot;
💚&quot;Yeah, I learned this trick from you, Senpai. I've grown up enough to understand what you've actually been doing for us all along.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm sorry for doing it without your approval first, but you're all used to that 'cause of Morisawa-senpai anyway…
I mean, the guy used to constantly make us do hero shows out of nowhere, right?&quot;
❤️&quot;…That's true.&quot;
❤️&quot;You've perfectly re-enacted my way of doing things, huh? You must've observed my lifestyle very carefully, and did your best to understand me.
That is, without a doubt, love. Thank you, I love you too.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm gonna kick you off the stage.&quot;
💚&quot;You guys have such a weird fixation on pointless stuff like who gets to wear the red uniform, but… I think we should all wear what we wanna wear, including our favorite color.&quot;
💚&quot;I hate how a convention that nobody even knows the origins of is souring Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun's relationship… That weird tradition can go eat shit.&quot;
❤️&quot;'Tradition can go eat shit,' huh…&quot;
❤️&quot;On our way here, Takamine and I had a similar conversation.
It was a little awkward because he kept throwing a tantrum, but one of the wonderful things about him is that he doesn't put up a strong front like I do.&quot;
❤️&quot;He's honest with himself, and so genuinely dazzling. He spoke out the feelings I was trying my best to hide deep inside me—the same feelings you guys likely had, too.&quot;
❤️&quot;While we were on the verge of losing hope from the crushing reality, Takamine found our true feelings for us. Then he did his best to extend his hand as far as he physically could to try and save our hearts—as a hero.&quot;
❤️&quot;In reality, as Takamine said, we could just wear outfits of the color we like—a color that suits who we are. And there's nobody else in this world who's wanted to wear the red color more than I have, ever since childhood.&quot;
❤️&quot;We'll start over and assemble everything all over again. What we want to protect isn't a tradition—it's our freedom, our happiness, and the smiles of ourselves and our fans.&quot;
💚&quot;Mhm, mhm, exactly… That's what you should've done from the very beginning.&quot;
Mini talks
💚(Let's search for… 'Morisawa, Chiaki'…
Huh, there really are a lot of people talking about his casting role in the new tokusatsu show… Where the heck did they get this info from, anyway…?)
💚&quot;I was searching topics about Morisawa-senpai on social media… I'd hate to find out that he's been talking behind our backs, so I regularly search his name as a check-up.
…Why're you asking me if I'm okay…? Isn't it normal to look up stuff about your senior online…?&quot;
💚&quot;Oh, you should blame Morisawa-senpai for that. I was just searching up his name on social media… I tend to search his name every once in a while, but I've been doing it way more often lately 'cause I'm frustrated that he's barely concerned about us nowadays…&quot;
💚&quot;Thanks to searching up his name, I have all his talk shows memorized in my head… Ugh, this sucks, I'm not even a fan of him or anything…&quot;
💚&quot;…Ah, please check this out. This soft drink ad just showed up on my social media. It's showing Morisawa-senpai in full… He's gotten a lot of comments from his fans, too.
Let's see… 'I'm wishing you the best, Chiaki-kun,' 'I love you, Chiaki-kun'… Man, he sure is popular…&quot;
💚&quot;Ohh, you're the one who suggested this to him? I mean, I guess it does suit his image and all, but… since I know what he's actually like, I can't help but feel like everyone's being tricked…
We're talking about a guy who literally yells &quot;Okaa-saaan!!&quot; to the ocean, y'know…?&quot;
💚&quot;Huh, the ad does kinda suit his image. I guess he does look like a pleasant person when he smiles—as long as he keeps his mouth shut, that is.
If only he always looked this calm in real life, and maybe then I'd finally be able to live my life peacefully…&quot;
💚&quot;No, it's just, he feels so far away… He was always pestering me every day last year… So why's it so hard just to meet up with him now…? It makes no sense to me…
I should give him an earful or two the next time we meet, don't you think? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea…&quot;
💚&quot;I know there's no point in me getting angry at an ad, but I'm kinda upset, like… 'What the hell are you smiling over when your unit's suffering right now'…&quot;
💚&quot;He's supposed to be the number one person who wants to be a hero, but instead he asks to leave the unit? Does he ever bother to think about how we feel?
If you're such a hero of justice and all, then how about you consider protecting your own comrades' feelings, huh…&quot;
💚&quot;Our seniors are always so random with their decisions. I wish they'd understand that you need to explain yourself first before deciding on something.&quot;

💚&quot;Yeah, but it's hard to tell what someone's order is if they're already the type to act weird… Like, for example, Morisawa-senpai's been acting suspiciously ever since we arrived in Okinawa—But I can't tell if it's because of his order, or if he's just being his usual self.&quot;
💚&quot;That guy gets lonely easily, after all… He'd much rather spend time being close with everyone as much as he can, so if he's been working on his own, then, yeah… I guess that really is his order.&quot;
💚&quot;You're not spilling private info about me to them, are you…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Fear not, Takamine! I doubt that Akatsuki has any interest in you!&quot;
💚&quot;Hah? I mean I guess that's true, but did you have to put it that way…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh? Don't you worry, Takamine! I'm extremely interested in you!&quot;
❤️&quot;I even double-checked with the SS administration if the way I planned it was okay, and they were alright with it!&quot;
💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai's strong point is that he can casually ask questions even to people who could be attacking him with malicious intent… I could never do that…&quot;
💚&quot;My order was super simple; I just had to avoid touching that thing I love during the round… and I'm not an infant or something… I can put up with it just fine…&quot;
❤️&quot;That thing you love? Oh, I get it now! So that's why you kept your distance from me all this time, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;We're pretty sensitive people… The only ones who're broad-minded enough to get through anything are Shinobu-kun and Shinkai-senpai… the ratio is two to three…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, you included me in the 'sensitive' category, too!? I'm so glad to know that you understand me, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;Hmph… You do realize we've known each other long enough that none of us would still think you're a hot-headed, dumbass hero without a single thought in his head, right… We've all seen you read books with glasses on before you sleep…&quot;
❤️&quot;What do glasses have to do with it!?&quot;
Mini talks
❤️&quot;Heheh, there are Okinawan souvenirs here! Oh, they have a handful of mascots; which do you think would suit Takamine, Sengoku? Since you're the same age as him, I'd be happy to get your advice on which to get him!&quot;
❤️&quot;They have a handful of mascots here; which do you think would suit Takamine, Sengoku?&quot;
💛&quot;The bitter melon mascot would suit him perfectly!&quot;
❤️&quot;You're right, Takamine would love a mascot souvenir based on a vegetable!&quot;
❤️&quot;It's lunch time now! Takamine, make sure that you eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪&quot;
💚&quot;Sigh…&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? Why're you sighing? Are you low on nutrients due to a lack of meat!? Eating well will help regulate your mood! Don't be picky with your food, okay?&quot;
❤️&quot;It's lunch time now! Takamine, make sure that you eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪&quot;
💚&quot;I know.&quot;
❤️&quot;Mhm, that's good then! I guess I meddled a little too much. We're in Okinawa, y'know? I'd love to see you try a few of their cuisine~♪&quot;
❤️&quot;It's lunch time now! Takamine, make sure that you eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪&quot;
💚&quot;I ate already.&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, that's good! I had the wrong idea because of the vegetables on your plate. Wonderful, Takamine, you ate so much! I'll eat just as much to grow big! ☆&quot;

💚&quot;Actually, wouldn't it be a good idea to ask our seniors for help, too? The more ideas, the better, right…? Plus, heroes are supposedly the type to come rushing to the rescue for anyone in need.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah, wait, that reminds me! The message was one thing, but you really didn't need to attach a photo of an entire box of eggplants after it!
Why did you go with an eggplant baron!? Weren't there plenty of other options among all the vegetables!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Why an eggplant baron!? Weren't there other vegetables you could choose!?&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? Didn't you always say that the stronger the enemy, the better? So I chose something powerful enough for you to struggle with.&quot;
❤️&quot;Gghh!? That's not how I expected my words to be interpreted…!&quot;
💚&quot;Didn't you always say that the stronger the enemy, the better? So I chose something powerful enough for you to struggle with.&quot;

❤️&quot;I did struggle to hold back blocking you on sight, even when I knew it was from you…!&quot;
💚&quot;Excuse me!? You've got some nerve to complain about our high quality eggplants… How about I send you a box for yourself, huh?&quot;
❤️&quot;I-I don't want it! I really, really don't!&quot;
💚&quot;There's no need to hold back…♪ I'm indebted to you time and time again, so it'll be like a summer gift.&quot;
❤️&quot;I-I'm not holding back anything, though…? While I'm grateful to receive gratitude from my junior, I quite honestly would rather you refrain from sending me a box!&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh!? W-What do you mean by all of that…!? Didn't we talk passionately about tokusatsu shows in our school year together!?&quot;
💚&quot;That's 'cause you always mention it to us after every Sunday… so we just so happened to follow along…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Hmm… Takamine's likely rooted in front of the souvenir shop in the village. Remember when we struggled to get him out of there after we were done with Scroll of the Elements?&quot;
Mini talks
🖤&quot;Midori-kun sent a fishy message to Morisawa-senpai that said 'eggy-eggplant', but he managed to understand it just fine, and I don't get how…&quot;
🖤&quot;Huh? You helped Midori-kun out with packing up eggplants in a box? Ahaha, he seriously sent Morisawa-senpai eggplants? I thought that was a joke…&quot;
🎀&quot;I wonder if he accepted those eggplants?&quot;
🖤&quot;I dunno… I haven't heard anything 'bout it. Oh, wait, I do kinda remember hearing a scream yesterday… It vaguely sounded like Morisawa-senpai's voice…&quot;
💚&quot;Ermm, let's see, we have our meeting at the half hour mark, which is ten minutes from now. Morisawa-senpai always says stuff like, 'It's only natural to be ten minutes early to a job as a working adult!', so I think you're right on time.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm gonna pack up this box of eggplants and send it to Morisawa-senpai. I sent him an urgent message the other day, but he arrived late to our meeting anyway, so this is gonna be his punishment.&quot;
🎀&quot;Would this really count as a punishment?&quot;
💚&quot;Well, it'd definitely work as one for Morisawa-senpai. But I heard heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary, so maybe he'll actually cry tears of joy for the opportunity.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm gonna place this eggplant box in front of Morisawa-senpai's room. I'm excited to see how he'll react…♪&quot;
🎀&quot;Will this make him happy?&quot;
💚&quot;Hmmm… I wrote 'Eggplants' really big on the box, so… He'll likely jump the moment he sees the box, for starters. He may not even try opening it… But, well, I'll see what I'll do when that happens.&quot;
🎀&quot;You're very close.&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? You think I have a close relationship with Morisawa-senpai…? No, no, that's not true… I don't know why you'd think we're on intimate terms…&quot;
❤️&quot;T-The truth is… there was a box in front of my dorm room yesterday… On it said 'to Morisawa-senpai', and… the name of that…&quot;
❤️&quot;Y-Yeah… Exactly, I received eggplants… I can only think of one person who'd do this, but I didn't expect him to actually send me a box…&quot;
❤️&quot;Heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary! I'll make sure to overcome this obstacle, no matter what it takes!&quot;

❤️&quot;I don't think Takamine means to run away either, though. When all five of us gather, the atmosphere becomes uncomfortable, and he likely doesn't like that, so he's been avoiding it altogether.&quot;
💙&quot;ah~ yes, midori has that side to him…&quot;
💛&quot;In the past, Morisawa-dono would always drag Midori-kun over by the collar, regardless of Midori-kun's grumbling, but…&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah… I'm not sure I can emotionally handle that kind of thing right now.&quot;
💚&quot;You're having a weird tokusatsu talk again… It's embarrassing being seen with you whenever you do that, so could you stop…? I'll be mistaken for a nerd…&quot;

❤️&quot;It's good to be busy, but are you okay? You'll hurt yourself if you keep on working nonstop… Are you sure you aren't overdoing it?&quot;
💚&quot;No… I think I'm closer to breaking down emotionally rather than physically, so I've been keeping myself busy to get my mind off things…&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't misunderstand, Takamine. You did nothing wrong. So you don't need to fret yourself over any of this.&quot;
💚&quot;There you go again; it's 'cause you never let us bear any of that burden that—&quot;
💛&quot;—Mm, mm!!&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, sorry, it got tense again… It's really painful to see, right…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine is still prioritizing his personal work as we speak, but… I suppose he can't boycott the work he had already agreed to do, so it can't be helped.
He used to have no motivation, but now works hard on his jobs no matter the reason. Personally, I refuse to oppose that.&quot;

💙&quot;yes~… the internet is so scary. i have come to understand that during the summer.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, but I don't think we should stay away from it excessively like how Takamine is.&quot;
💙&quot;emergency! emergency!&quot;
❤️&quot;It's a brand new day, Takamine! Goood mooorning! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Oh… I'm in a dream, huh…&quot;
❤️&quot;Now, now, you shouldn't escape reality so quickly, Takamine! Open your eyes! Look around you! The reality known as us has arrived! Fuhahaha! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;What do you want so early in the morning…? Not only Morisawa-senpai, but even Shinkai-senpai… Unlike that guy over there, you aren't the kind of insane person who would attack someone in their sleep, right?&quot;
💚&quot;I'm begging you, please don't terrorize my peaceful daily life… Are you two a natural disaster or kaijuu or something?&quot;
❤️&quot;Why, of course we aren't kaijuu! We're heroes of justice! We're trying our hardest to be that!&quot;
❤️&quot;I can't even reach a signal, no matter how many times I phone him.&quot;
💚&quot;It's not 'cause you were so annoying that he blocked you… right?&quot;
❤️&quot;Nope! I think it's only you who'd do something as cruel as that to me, Takamine!&quot;
❤️&quot;It's a burden to always ask for a mediator like Kanata to relay my messages whenever I want to contact you!&quot;
💚&quot;It's an honor to know that I was able to become special to you, Senpai.&quot;
❤️&quot;Mhm! I'd love it if we could become special in a more positive way! You little~! ♪&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm sure even you understand that we can't just stand around and do nothing, right, Takamine?&quot;
💚&quot;Well, yeah, obviously… But what're we even planning to do? You can't get contact with either of them, right?&quot;
💚&quot;You're not gonna suggest going there to find out, are you…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep, that's exactly what we'll do! Worry not, Takamine! I've already told our agency! We can leave our work aside and focus on this matter!&quot;
💚&quot;It's only when it's least necessary that he's super fast to work…&quot;
❤️&quot;In fact, this is what I should've done yesterday! I regret not taking action earlier…! Due to my careless decisions, even Sengoku has fallen prey to them!&quot;
💚&quot;Erm, he's not dead or anything though, right? Isn't he smiling and doing a peace sign in the photo…?&quot;
🖤&quot;So I wouldn't be wrong to assume that this means that Crimson Production is on the side of justice, would I?&quot;
❤️&quot;Guhhh… This is so frustrating. There's nothing I can even say to counter that…&quot;
💚&quot;Just seeing Morisawa-senpai this frustrated brings me joy somehow.&quot;
💚&quot;Just seeing Morisawa-senpai this frustrated brings me joy somehow.&quot;
❤️&quot;W-Why, Takamine!? Why are you happy!? I don't recall ever raising you to be such a mean-spirited boy, who would laugh at other people's demise!&quot;
💚&quot;I don't recall being raised by you, either.&quot;
💙&quot;fufu, thanks to midori's realistic response, we did not raise suspicions among the staff members.&quot;
❤️&quot;Well, that's just an afterthought. To be honest, I didn't think Takamine would participate in this mission at all.&quot;
❤️&quot;I thought Takamine would be too terrified to participate in our plan, and would ask to stay back at a hotel. Were that the case, I was planning to have him return to ES alone and be a messenger to report various matters to Tenshouin.&quot;
💚&quot;Why would you think that…?&quot;
❤️&quot;The moment I touched your hand, Nagumo, I knew for sure that you didn't betray us — that you didn't become tainted with evil. I was certain that you were still one of us.&quot;
💚&quot;That's just plain incredible… I genuinely thought Tetora-kun did a complete 180…&quot;
💚&quot;He's too good at acting, that not even society realizes Morisawa-senpai's just an imposter acting as a hero. So they misunderstand and unreasonably raise the bar for him, that if he shows his true self now, they'll accuse him of being a liar and a fraud… It's pretty sad.&quot;
💚&quot;So they misunderstand and unreasonably raise the bar for him, that if he shows his true self now, they'll accuse him of being a liar and a fraud… It's pretty sad.&quot;
❤️&quot;You understand me far too well, Takamine. It just goes to show how much you love me.&quot;
💚&quot;Just die.&quot;
🖤&quot;I don't think you guys need to force yourselves to get involved with this. Tomorrow, I'll turn a blind eye to let you guys escape. I want you to get some rest today in preparation for that.&quot;
💚&quot;Now you're also being distant… You've really inherited all the wrong things…&quot;
❤️&quot;Everyone will do their best in their respective roles, and will definitely be able to produce a wonderful piece of art.&quot;
💚&quot;What are you even on about? You suddenly become so enthusiastic whenever it's about tokusatsu…&quot;
❤️&quot;No, I'm talking about real life.&quot;
🖤&quot;I didn't know a tunnel existed… Maybe we could use it as an escape route as a last resort.&quot;
💚&quot;Nah, I doubt this'd connect all the way to the outside… They wouldn't choose this place for our confinement otherwise.&quot;
❤️&quot;That'd be a little too careless on their side, yeah.&quot;
🖤&quot;They may catch on if we keep repeating this, but it should still be okay for now. Midori-kun's known as the unmotivated character.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah. In fact, it's surprising that even Takamine stayed in this dangerous place. He could've run back to ES as soon as he had the chance…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine's been a man with an element of surprise this time around.&quot;
💚&quot;If you're actually surprised, then that just means you never once understood me. Besides, we all decided that we'd stay here together. I don't wanna be the only one who's left out.&quot;
💚&quot;We all decided that we'd stay here together. I don't wanna be the only one who's left out.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah. Let's all work together to accomplish this mission.&quot;
💙&quot;chiaki~ you aren't allowed to make any orders. tetora is the taichou right now.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah, right. Sorry about that.&quot;
💚&quot;We just went from 'Ryuseitai' to 'Ryuseitai Black'… I don't feel like much has changed.&quot;
❤️&quot;I like it, it reminds me of Kamen Rider!&quot;
💚&quot;With the usual Ryuseitai, I don't really get to play as a villain 'cause Morisawa-senpai doesn't like those roles much, so this feels new… Ahh~ It's sooo much easier to play the villain~ You don't have to worry about all kinds of things~…♪&quot;
💚&quot;I don't have to preach about justice or morality or whatever else I don't even believe in.&quot;
❤️&quot;Y-You disliked playing the hero of justice that much!? You could've told me so!&quot;
💚&quot;Did it look like I could ever mention that?&quot;
💚&quot;Life is so easy when someone else does all the work to solve the problem without you ever lifting a finger.&quot;
❤️&quot;You weren't having an easy time either, though. You're so worn out that you have circles under your eyes, Takamine. You did your best, too. We all did our best.&quot;
❤️&quot;Starting with the guy who's trying to look like he has nothing to do with this — Takamine! You're very much involved in this, too! Let's hear your thoughts on your ideal Ryuseitai — 'Ryuseitai Green'! I want you to speak your mind without any hesitation!&quot;
❤️&quot;Let's hear your thoughts on your ideal Ryuseitai — 'Ryuseitai Green'! I want you to speak your mind without any hesitation!&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhh…? Ughhh, this is turning out to be such a pain… But eh… I guess it's fine. I feel like we're finally going back to how we used to be.&quot;
Mini talks
💚&quot;Hmm… I don't really watch that much stuff, honestly.
Ah— This one tokusatsu movie Morisawa-senpai showed me before was pretty interesting. I watched it a long time ago though, so I don't even remember the name anymore…&quot;
🎀&quot;Is it a tokusatsu DVD?&quot;
💚&quot;Of course not. I already get forced by Morisawa-senpai to watch a bunch of them…
I don't have to go out of my way to rent one, just asking that guy is enough… He'd even lend me bonus DVDs and whatnot… Not that I ever plan to borrow any from him…&quot;
🎀&quot;Good morning!!&quot;
💚&quot;Wah!? You scared me, Anzu-san… Good morning.
'You seemed down, so I tried greeting you energetically'…? Please don't become like Morisawa-senpai too…&quot;
🎀&quot;What hurts the most?&quot;
💚&quot;How powerless I feel, and how it feels like all I'm doing is throwing tantrums… Or how Morisawa-senpai doesn't talk to his own unit about anything… Or how nothing's been working out for us… I don't even know anymore… What's hurting me so much…?&quot;
Wedding March!

❤️&quot;Heeey, Takamine! There you are! I was looking for you.&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh—You've got the wrong person, I'm not Takamine Midori…&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! ☆ I never once said 'Midori,' and you won't fool me with that trick!&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh… I'm tired enough as it is, why did I have to come across such an exhausting person… Did you want something from me?&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm? You look worn out… It isn't that big of a deal, so I can keep it for another day.&quot;
💚&quot;No, you can tell me now… I'm curious to hear what it is…&quot;
💚&quot;No, you can tell me now… I'm curious to hear what it is, so…&quot;
❤️&quot;Are you sure? Don't push yourself, okay? But alright, so, the truth is—I actually got a request from a bridal company, and accepted the job offer alongside Sazanami.&quot;
💚&quot;…And?&quot;
❤️&quot;That's it! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;I actually got a request from a bridal company, and accepted the job offer alongside Sazanami.&quot;
💚&quot;…And?&quot;
❤️&quot;That's it! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Wow, it really wasn't a big deal at all…&quot;
❤️&quot;That's why I said so earlier!&quot;
💚&quot;I didn't think it was gonna be that stupid…&quot;
❤️&quot;Anzu suggested that I take reference from the promotional video Ring.A.Bell took alongside their MV. I kept re-watching how you played your part and analyzed it as much as I could, then I applied it to my own performance, and it worked out in my favor. Thank you, Takamine!&quot;
❤️&quot;I kept watching how you played your part and analyzed it as much as I could, then I applied it to my own performance, and it worked out in my favor. Thank you, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;How am I supposed to respond to that… And why'd Anzu-san have to suggest that PV in the first place…&quot;
❤️&quot;She only recommended the video; she never once mentioned you, Takamine.
I had quite a few options to reference from, but my eyes were drawn to you the most—maybe because we're both from the same unit.&quot;
❤️&quot;I had quite a few options to reference from in the video, but my eyes were drawn to you the most—maybe because we're both from the same unit. That's just more proof that your aura and charm are skyrocketing! You should be proud of yourself, Takamine!&quot;
❤️&quot;That's just more proof that your aura and charm are skyrocketing! You should be proud of yourself!&quot;
💚&quot;It feels uncomfortable and gross that you kept watching me over and over again, but I guess it's whatever in the end. The video is out to the public, after all…&quot;
💚&quot;Do you and Sazanami-senpai know each other from something?&quot;
❤️&quot;Well…The first time I met him was—&quot;
💚&quot;Wh—Why're you suddenly narrating a whole backstory… You don't have to tell me if it'll take forever.&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't be like that! Isn't it good to learn more about other people?&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, really!? You're on close terms with Sazanami, then! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;I just said he's an acquaintance… Could you please try to listen to what I'm saying?&quot;
❤️&quot;That's what I understood from listening to you. Acquaintances don't typically lend each other their belongings, y'know?&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! ☆ Your dad is happy to know that your friend circle has expanded so much more since the day he met you!&quot;
💚&quot;You're not my dad, though?&quot;
❤️&quot;I just learned that you're getting along with Takamine over at your circle! ☆ As his senior from Ryuseitai, I really appreciate that! I'd love it if you could keep getting along with him!&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't act like my guardian, it's so embarrassing…&quot;
💚&quot;Sazanami-senpai, I heard you worked on a job with Morisawa-senpai. Wasn't it rough working with someone so obnoxious and suffocating?&quot;
🌊&quot;Not at all~ Morisawa-senpai is a real nice guy; he was always so considerate of me.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep, it was Ring.A.Bell's PV! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;I knew it… Please never recommend it to someone ever again.&quot;
❤️&quot;Huh? But you let it slide just a moment ago, because 'the video is out to the public'…?&quot;
💚&quot;It's fine if someone else does it, but you're not allowed to.&quot;
❤️&quot;Why's that!?&quot;
🌊(Ahaha, so this is how Takamine-kun's like when Morisawa-senpai's around, huh~ He acts a lot differently from how he is in Manga Club, so it kinda feels new to me…)
❤️&quot;—Found you, Takamine~! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;What do you want, Morisawa-senpai… If it's something pointless like the other day, I'm gonna tie you up to the tree in the courtyard, 'kay…?&quot;
❤️&quot;What an elaborate punishment! It sounds like the sort of predicament a hero could find himself in.&quot;
❤️&quot;Worry not! I have a proper reason why I wanted to see you. This is for you! Give me your hand.&quot;
💚&quot;A capsule toy of a mascot character!? And a super rare one at that!? Why, though? It's not even my birthday…
Oh, I see what this is. There's a catch to this, isn't there?&quot;
💚&quot;Ah, I see… You'd like me to join the project, since I have experience with bridal work…&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep! We'd have a hundred men's worth of power on our side if you were with us! You did an outstanding job in Ring.A.Bell, after all! ☆&quot;
❤️&quot;You did an outstanding job in Ring.A.Bell, after all! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;No, I didn't… and I can't join your project, anyway.&quot;
❤️&quot;Why not!?&quot;
💚&quot;Because I'm a member of Ring.A.Bell. I'm under a contract where I'm not allowed to take any bridal-related jobs for the year.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ahh… I suppose there's no working around that if that's the case…&quot;
💚&quot;You won't try to persist? That's not like you…&quot;
❤️&quot;Well, there isn't much we can do about that, is there? Persisting won't change anything.&quot;
💚&quot;You won't try to persist? That's not like you…&quot;
❤️&quot;Well, there isn't much we can do about that, is there? Persisting won't change anything. It's a shame, but I'll try to find someone else. See you then, Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;Okay… Sorry, I kinda feel bad…&quot;
💚&quot;…Please wait a moment, Morisawa-senpai. Take this capsule toy back. I almost considered keeping it, but… I barely got to help you out, and I don't feel right taking it like this…&quot;
❤️&quot;I'd rather you keep the toy with you. It's already yours now!&quot;
💚&quot;Are you sure…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yep! I don't have any reason to keep it, and I'm sure the mascot character would be much happier under the hands of someone who'd adore it! Think of it as me, and cherish it well…☆&quot;
❤️&quot;I don't have any reason to keep it, and I'm sure the mascot would be much happier under the hands of someone who'd adore it! Think of it as me, and cherish it well…☆&quot;
💚&quot;No thanks… You and mascots are poles apart, like heaven and earth… But thank you, Morisawa-senpai.&quot;
💚&quot;I know I can't collaborate with you officially, but if there's anything else I could help you with, please let me know. I'll try my best within my capabilities…&quot;
❤️&quot;Mhm, you've grown so much, Takamine! ☆ I'd love to ask for your help when the time comes!&quot;
❤️&quot;I didn't expect Takamine to reject me… I was planning under the notion that he'd accept my invitation, so this is a hard hit on me.&quot;
💚&quot;Hold on, Morisawa-senpai's calling me. Hello…?
W-What the… All I hear is heavy breathing… Could you not play creepy pranks on me…?&quot;
💚(I wanna make things even between us after he gave me that capsule toy, so… Sazami-senpai's favorite food, huh… …Ah, maybe—)
— —
❤️&quot;…Ohh, I see! Thank you, Takamine!&quot;
👓&quot;What's this!? Player Morisawa has just used his 'call'!&quot;
❤️&quot;'I'll send you strawberries once they're in season'… Ah, from Takamine. It sounds like he's still bothered by his mistake.&quot;
🌊&quot;I don't blame him for thinking broccoli was my fav, though~ Could you also let him know that he doesn't have to worry about it?&quot;
❤️&quot;Mhm! I will.&quot;
Mini talks
❤️&quot;Ohh! The pattern design on this marriage form is of that yuruchara Takamine's been into lately! It might make him happy if it was given to him!&quot;

❤️&quot;Do you mean Metalder!? Is this like another episodic story from Superhuman-Machine Metalder!?&quot;
💚&quot;Ughh, so annoying… I hate that this guy's tokusatsu nerdy side lit back up — probably 'cause things finally got sorted out for our unit…&quot;
Tropical
(48, complete)
❤️&quot;Hahaha, Takamine, you've got so many thoughts to share with us, y'know? I feel like that's exactly why Nagumo chose you as the next in line.&quot;
❤️&quot;You've never truly had an opportunity to stand out in the center, so if anything, I think that having you as our next commander would certainly demonstrate to the world that Ryuseitai has powered up, Takamine. I feel like it's a great opportunity!&quot;
🖤&quot;If Midori-kun can't be the leader, I guess I'll go with someone else…?&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm always prepared to take the position! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;No, you're better off as a regular member for a while. Do you have any idea how long you've been acting as the leader…?&quot;
❤️&quot;You see, Takamine lives right by my dorm room, and… He apparently hasn't been showing up in his room for the past few days. I only discovered this when Tenma-kun asked me if something had happened.&quot;
❤️&quot;Either way, we won't know unless we ask him… I'm really worried. Although… While Takamine is typically one to conserve his energy, I can only hope that he's decided to travel about in order to train himself for the commander position.&quot;
💛&quot;Indeed. After all, Midori-kun might collapse if he frets too much all on his own. I, too, shall see if there are any eyewitness reports!&quot;
❤️&quot;Thank you, that'd be a huge help. I'll be sure to message you all if I find out anything about him, too.&quot;
❤️&quot;Excuuse meee!&quot;
💚&quot;Woah, what the hell!?&quot;
❤️&quot;You seem down, Takamine! Your Ryuseitai comrades have come to your rescue! So let's all properly talk with one another! Now, come on, follow me!&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh, don't just barge into someone's room! Nobody asked you to cheer me up, anyway!&quot;
💚&quot;You can't just enter my room without permission!&quot;
❤️&quot;Worry not, I didn't enter without permission. Your mother allowed me in!&quot;
💚&quot;M-Mom…!? Don't let this suffocating guy in here! Think a little more about how your own son would feel…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Hahaha, no need to be so shy! Aren't we comrades who share the same spirit!? Everyone is waiting for you at the shop's entrance! If you don't come down, then we'll all just have to come to your room, Takamine…☆&quot;
💚&quot;Eeeep…!&quot;
❤️&quot;No need to be embarrassed! I've also decorated my room with sentai DVDs and figurines. Being passionate about your interests is a wonderful thing!&quot;
💚&quot;Don't talk to me all high and mighty after barging into my room… You're the one person I don't want coming here…&quot;
❤️&quot;So that's what it was… Sorry, we barged in without a regard for your actual reasons, Takamine. We thought that you might've been stressed about your leadership position, so we were prepared to lighten your burden if so, but—I see that it was all unfounded worry.&quot;
❤️&quot;Fortunately, we can be flexible with our schedule for the unit right now. Let's group up again after you've taken a rest and recovered, Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm gonna rest for a little longer in my home… I'll let you guys know when I've recovered.&quot;
❤️&quot;Got it. We're waiting for you, Takamine. Alright then, we'll be having basic practice sessions until you're back!&quot;
💙&quot;take your time, okay, midori? ♪&quot;
💙&quot;i do hope midori feels better after a bit of rest…&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah… I'd like to believe that he'll come back to us in great shape, but since he's closed off his heart… The issue might linger. If push comes to shove, we may have to do another lottery to decide on the new leader.&quot;
❤️&quot;That makes sense. There's no need to force a decision on what you want to do in Ryuseitai. That sort of thing comes about naturally. Actually, maybe we should have given Takamine more time to think about his unit, too…&quot;
❤️&quot;…We need to keep this matter in mind. Takamine seems to be in low spirits due to something else, but even so, we should have given him more time.&quot;
💙&quot;that is true~ i only started to think about my own unit on the off chance that midori needs more time to rest…&quot;
❤️&quot;It's almost a miracle that Takamine remained as an idol with us, after all. But I'm sure Takamine will bring a new color into Ryuseitai eventually. I believe in him!&quot;
❤️&quot;…Hm? I got a message from Anzu on Holdhands. Hmm…? Takamine is coming soon, so we should wait at the office…? I was so engrossed in our meeting that I didn't notice the message at all. It seems like she messaged me an hour ago, so—&quot;
💚&quot;……H-Hello.&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm sure that you just didn't want to spoil our fun, right? You wanted to wait until we were done talking! How admirable of you, Takamine! ♪&quot;
💚&quot;……(Turns to leave)&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah— Wait! I'm sorry if I offended you!&quot;
💚&quot;You really know how to hit on someone's nerve…&quot;
💚&quot;Is it alright if I talk to all of you about something?&quot;
❤️&quot;Go for it! If it'll help you stand back up once more, then I'm willing to be a stepping stone or an outlet for your thoughts!&quot;
💚&quot;There's zero reason to be suffocating about this… Please just listen to me normally.&quot;
💚&quot;My vision's not something as serious as Tetora-kun's vision was, y'know…? Are you really sure…?&quot;
❤️&quot;There's no need to worry about that. Ryuseitai doesn't have to stick to only looking cool. Any form is the correct way to go about it, as long as it makes someone happy.&quot;
💚&quot;…This is how I envision our new form of Ryuseitai.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ohh…? The stage is overflowing with the color green… Ah, I got it! We will protect nature… as RG!&quot;
💚&quot;That unit name isn't soft at all, so we're not going with it.&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, I see where you're going with this. That's why there are pages about our unit in the planning; it was to send it to the company. A mascot character sentai squad… That sounds really interesting.&quot;
💚&quot;It's not a sentai squad, though.&quot;
💚&quot;Besides, I'm not bold enough to try and convince people through sheer force the same way Morisawa-senpai does with sentai hero stuff…  ……No, I'm getting negative again. I need to get myself together…&quot;
💚&quot;I tend to push myself to perform as properly as possible, which honestly doesn't feel soft and fluffy at all…&quot;
❤️&quot;I think it's fine to work as hard as you possibly can, though.&quot;
💚&quot;…?&quot;
❤️&quot;It's because sentai shows are intended for children that they can't cut corners. It's that sort of fighting spirit that drives them to perform at their best. So I think it's perfectly fine for you to perform as hard as you possibly can, as a mascot character, Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;Um, mascots and sentai heroes are entirely different things, though…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Wh—…! Well, um, you're right about that, but…! What I mean to say is, you don't need to hold back with us… You're welcome to go full force with me!&quot;
💚&quot;If only I had a bit more confidence… If I could just lead Ryuseitai the same way Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun did, maybe I wouldn't need to worry… But as soon as it's on me to teach everyone what to do, I start to feel like I'm not capable to lead them…&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine looks so happy today. It's almost unbelievable that he was depressed just a few days ago.&quot;
💚&quot;Don't mind me, Morisawa-senpai! Just look at Pop-dayuu!&quot;
❤️&quot;Hahaha, you're right. Your hero is finally here, after all — It would be rude to have my eyes elsewhere.&quot;
❤️&quot;Pop-dayuu~!! Wave at me, too! (waves)&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, stop, you're way too loud…!! The star of this show is Pop-dayuu, y'know!?&quot;
🖤&quot;Woah, Midori-kun is dead serious…&quot;
❤️&quot;Right then, Takamine! What do we have to do next? We'd love to know more! Tell us everything about your love for mascot characters…☆&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine, watch my performance, too! Look, what do you think of my Plateypus form!? 'I WANNA EAT SOME TASTY FOOD-PLATEY!!!'&quot;
💚&quot;That's way too forceful!! Are you messing around here, Morisawa-senpai!? Yelling like that is a disservice to Plateypus, you hear me!?&quot;
💚&quot;That's way too forceful!! Are you messing around here, Morisawa-senpai!? Yelling like that is a disservice to Plateypus, you hear me!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Sorry, I just tried to say it in an energetic way—I didn't mean to look as though I'm messing around…&quot;
❤️&quot;H-How about now? That was good, wasn't it?&quot;
🖤&quot;Midori-kun, I'd like to know your thoughts, too! It was tricky on my own, but actin' out a conversation with Morisawa-senpai made me loosen up a li'l, I think!&quot;
💚&quot;U-Um… I do think you've gotten better from the first take, but…&quot;
💚(Mm~… I feel like Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun aren't getting adjusted to Yuruseitai after all… But, well, it also took a while for me to get used to acting like a villain for RB, so I can't talk like I'm any better…)
💚(I feel like I'm getting tired way faster, probably 'cause I'm leading the unit right now… I don't have as much stamina as Morisawa-senpai, so I think I'm gonna have to take a break every few days.)
❤️&quot;Sengoku, what do I have to do in order to become a much more soothing presence…!? I'm not doing enough to create the atmosphere that Takamine desires! I also want to give off a gentle aura, just like you and Kanata!&quot;
❤️&quot;I was expecting something much softer for Yuruseitai's stage, but… was this also what you had in mind from the start?&quot;
💚&quot;Where were you looking, Morisawa-senpai? I only told you guys to relax and take it easy; I never once said anything about becoming a mascot character…?&quot;
❤️&quot;I see. So all along, you cherished my likes, too. I'm fired up now! I'll do my absolute best to ensure I convey your likes to the whole venue…!&quot;
💚&quot;Ahaha. Sure, but if you start to stiffen up again, I'll get angry, okay…? ♪&quot;
❤️(You did incredible work, Takamine. You truly give off the aura of a commander. But… Haha, it's sort of a bizarre sight to dance alongside mascot characters.)
💚&quot;Ahh, I'm so depressed…&quot;
❤️&quot;You seem to have surpassed your limits during Tropical Live, Takamine. But it'll be alright! Now that you've conquered your duties as commander, you can definitely do anything!&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't try to beat a corpse back to life…&quot;
❤️&quot;Ooh, and there's even a mascot company who watched our live show, and has sent a request for us to collaborate with their mascot…? This is wonderful news, Takamine. Your likes seems to have brought us new encounters~♪&quot;
Mini talks
🎀&quot;I think greeting properly is important.&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, yes, that's the absolute basics. Morisawa-senpai also often says that 'Greetings are crucial! ☆' — Though when it comes to him, I think what he needs to be focusing on is the volume of his voice.&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine couldn't bear to watch my attempts at being soft, so he introduced me to a mascot character that resembles me. It's an octopus mascot that wants to be a police officer. Despite its earnest, fiery choice of words, it moves in a droopy, adorable way.&quot;
🎀&quot;The mascot really is cute.&quot;
❤️&quot;Isn't it? Honestly, I didn't expect to get this attached to it, but… Takamine introduced me to this character just for my sake. Just that thought alone makes it look all the more adorable to me.&quot;
🎀&quot;The mascot's like a teacher to you, huh?&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, a teacher…! I like that! I should call this character my teacher from now on!
Ah, but… Takamine might scold me and warn me not to give it my own nickname…&quot;
❤️&quot;Now that I've finished warming up, I'm in perfect shape to show off all the softness Takamine hammered into me to the maximum! It's time to let aside being cool and fiery, and instead perform in a fun, cheerful, and super soft way~♪&quot;
🎀&quot;I'm looking forward to it.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, I'm also excited for you to witness Ryuseitai under Takamine's lead! I'm sure you have a lot of work as a producer, but still, I hope you can watch over us until the very end! ☆&quot;

🖤&quot;Aight, I'd like to mention this upfront: Morisawa-senpai, you stink, so please don't get near me.&quot;
❤️&quot;That's so mean!? Eh? Eh!? Takamine keeps criticizing me for stinking of sweat, so I've been really careful, though…!?&quot;
🖤&quot;The amount of deodorant you use is way too much.&quot;
❤️&quot;I really am! I'm a delicate guy, like a fruit that rots from wherever it's touched!&quot;
💚&quot;……Morisawa Durian Chiaki.&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't call me by the name of a stinky fruit in a whisper! That's bullying! There's bullying taking place in Ryuseitai…!&quot;
💚&quot;Durians are also delicious fruits, though… They're the king of fruits…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh! So what you were trying to say is that I may have my weak points, but I have my strong points too, Takamine! You sure are bad at compliments!&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't stray too far, Takamine. We may not be able to find each other again if we lose track of each other. Here; if you're feeling anxious, big brother will gladly hold your hand~♪&quot;
💚&quot;…tch…&quot;
❤️&quot;He clicked his tongue!? Why!? I really was trying to be considerate, though…!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Here; if you're feeling anxious, big brother will gladly hold your hand~♪&quot;

❤️&quot;I'm a guy you can always rely on! But of course, this job is focused around Kanata, our commander — so I'm trying not to meddle too much!&quot;
💚&quot;Don't call me by sama… Master Artist calls me by that too, but I'm nobody important…&quot;
🔹&quot;But I must show respect to my elders.&quot;
❤️&quot;How admirable! Takamine, you should learn from him! I want you to show me more respect!
💚&quot;When have you ever done something respectable, huh?&quot;
🔹&quot;Fufu. Midori-sama's extremely perceptive. Incredible… You understand how I feel.&quot;
❤️&quot;Of course! Takamine's incredible! He's a perceptive boy who can sense and understand all the subtleties in someone's delicate heart! Thank you! For appreciating Takamine's wonderful trait…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Of course! Takamine is incredible! He's a perceptive boy who can sense and understand all the subtleties within someone's delicate heart! I have to thank you! For appreciating Takamine's wonderful trait…!&quot;
💚&quot;Why are you so proud of that.&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm the one who raised Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;There's really not that many great things lying around outside the island either, though.&quot;
❤️&quot;Hey now! Don't interrupt the conversation with unpleasant comments! Now you're showing your bad trait, Takamine!&quot;
💚&quot;Hmph, so sorry for being negative…&quot;
💚&quot;zzz… zzz…♪&quot;
❤️(And Takamine, sound asleep~ Whew, I'm so glad they're all sleeping nice and peacefully.)
💚&quot;Just die.&quot;
❤️&quot;—……!?&quot;
💚&quot;Mngh… (mumble, mumble)… Fools who defy mascots will face the death penalty~… zzz…♪&quot;
❤️(Whew. He was just sleep talking.)
🖤&quot;Ossu, we're good there. It's just that Shinkai-senpai is unusually over-excited, so we were kinda surprised in a way.&quot;
💚&quot;Right…? We've got enough of that from Morisawa-senpai, y'know… I'd prefer it if Shinkai-senpai always stays as the healing presence, being floaty and taking it easy…&quot;
❤️→💙&quot;You've been flowing along with whatever I wanted to do for so long. It's now my turn to do the same.&quot;
———
💚→💙&quot;When I was made to be the commander, everyone gave their absolute best from start to end. It's now my turn to do the same, right? Mhm, probably…&quot;
❤️&quot;Fufu.&quot;
💚&quot;No more fish… No more fish…&quot;
💛&quot;Ah— Midori-kun is reliving his trauma again!?&quot;
❤️&quot;Are you alright, Takamine!? Look, here are some vegetables! Fresh, spring vegetables…!&quot;
💚&quot;Uu, uu— Vegetables? Not fish…?&quot;
❤️&quot;Even tokusatsu heroes don't ever one-sidedly eradicate evil without question.&quot;
💚&quot;It's overbearing how Senpai compares everything to tokusatsu… But, well, I get what you're trying to say.&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm not proud of taking on such an unheroic, underhanded method. After all, we took everyone outside of Hoshijima in the form of a surprise attack—&quot;
💙&quot;fufu. what are you saying, when you are the same person who would always force midori outside?&quot;
Mini talks
💙&quot;i feel like if i got to see tetora and shinobu, it would soothe me…♪&quot;
🎀&quot;Shall we invite the other two?&quot;
💙&quot;do you mean chiaki and midori? it is about time for their job to end, yes~? okay, i will contact them from my side. i hope we can all gather and talk together…♪&quot;
Ryuseitai Album TRIP
(8, complete)
❤️&quot;If we could, I'd love to sing it another ten more times…!&quot;
💚&quot;Ten…? We don't have the time for that, so please go do karaoke after this live or something.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ooh, that's a great idea! Alright, we're having our closing party at a karaoke room, then! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ten times…? We don't have the time, so please go do karaoke after this live.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ooh, that's a great idea! Alright, we'll have our closing party at a karaoke room, then! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhh, that's such a pain, it'd just exhaust me… Please go on your own, or at least without me.&quot;
💚&quot;Shinobu-kun talked about ninjas just a while ago, didn't he… But Suisei HALATION is also a song packed with all of Morisawa-senpai's 'likes', right?&quot;
❤️&quot;Mhm! A showdown with a space kaijuu gets me extremely excited every time!&quot;
❤️&quot;Take this: Hyper Infinite Justice Beam! Bibibibibibi…!&quot;
💙&quot;bibibibibibi…☆&quot;
💚&quot;…………&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine~?&quot; 💙&quot;midori~?&quot;
💚&quot;(Uu, I don't wanna say it… But even our audience is doing a weird 'bibibi' chant, too…)
……Bibibibibibi.&quot;
💚&quot;Guhh, I'm so frustrated… At the start of the live show, Morisawa-senpai said that he wants to 'sing this song another ten more times', right?
I got so baffled by that, like, 'The hell is this guy saying?', but… I just thought the exact same thing right now.&quot;
💚&quot;I won't actually ask for as many times as that guy, really… I just wanna dance with 'Tropical Troppeys' at least another nine more times…&quot;
💛&quot;Ermm… That isn't really any different from ten times, you know~…?&quot;
💙&quot;human beings live their lives while influencing one another. you are also gradually resembling chiaki, aren't you, midori?&quot;
💚&quot;Please don't say something like that, it's upsetting… Sigh, me, becoming similar to that guy… This must be a nightmare…&quot;
💚&quot;…Up until this point, I'd somehow manage to make it through by leaving it up to everyone, like Morisawa-senpai… But from now on, we'll be taking turns being the leader, so I've got to get used to doing MC segments, don't I…&quot;

🦇&quot;Ah, that takes me back. Takamine-kun would always shrink back in fear upon seeing Sena-kun and I. You would yell, 'Save me, Morisawa-senpai!' over every little thing.&quot;

🍇&quot;Uu… P-Please let me goo~! And then let me disappeaaarrrr……&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm~… But just by watching Ayase, I can't help but be reminded of Takamine when I first met him, and so I can't get myself to leave you on your own…&quot;
❤️&quot;—Inhaaaaale… Exhaaaale……Mm.
(The clean air is so serene, it feels nice. My mind feels clearer now.
I wonder if it's because there's a lot of greenery in this field? I somehow feel like it's been a while since I got to take a deep breath…)&quot;
💚&quot;Mm. The green flame is the mark of compassion! The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori! —Alright.&quot;
———
❤️&quot;……The red flame is the mark of justice. The sun of life, burning bright red. Ryusei Red, Morisawa Chiaki……
—Alright.&quot;
❤️&quot;Fufu, so that's how that cute song came about, huh?
Thing is, though… I honestly doubt that'd be enough for my mind to stray away from eggplants. If it were Takamine, I bet he'd be really thrilled, saying it looks like a yuruchara dance…
………
If it were Takamine…?&quot;
❤️(—Hold on. It's because it's me trying to harvest the eggplants that I find it impossible. However, if I were to let Takamine possess me inside…?
Takamine is a boy who loves vegetables, suited to don the Green of compassion.)
❤️(Takamine is a boy who loves vegetables, suited to don the Green of compassion. So if I let him possess me, then wouldn't even I, the weakest person against eggplants, be capable of fighting against them…!?)
&quot;It's Den-O ♪ Den-O! ♪&quot;
❤️&quot;Making Takamine possess me—Or rather, tracing him is a piece of cake for me! I haven't been watching him this whole time just for nothing! I'll show you that I can become Takamine perfectly…☆&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm Takamine…I'm Takamine…I'm Takamine… (mumblemumble)&quot;
🍇&quot;Let's sing and dance the song from the beginning!&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm Takamine…I'm Takamine…I'm Takamine… mumblemumble&quot;
🐦&quot;Crispy lettuce and bright red tomatoes~♪&quot;
🍇&quot;What splendid vegetables, coming in all colors~♪ Let's be friends even with the eggplants you can't stand~♪&quot;
❤️&quot;The sun shining bright, delighted and excited~♪ Here we have vegetables blessed by the earth~♪ Enjoy your meal with these splendid vegetables~♪
(It's coming… It's coming to me! I feel myself becoming one with Takamine in body and soul…!)
—I… I AM TAKAMINE NOWWWWWW!!&quot;
❤️(It's coming… It's coming to me! I feel myself becoming one with Takamine in body and soul…!)
&quot;—I… I AM TAKAMINE NOWWWWWW!!&quot;
❤️&quot; '—I… I AM TAKAMINE NOWWWWWW!!' &quot;
💚&quot;That's Gundam. It's not even Den-O.&quot;
💛&quot;Awawawa—!? M-Midori-kun, you shouldn't try to throw the remote at the TV…!?&quot;
❤️&quot; '—I… I AM TAKAMINE NOWWWWWW!!' &quot;
💚&quot;That's Gundam. It's not even Den-O.&quot;
💛&quot;Awawawa—!? M-Midori-kun, you shouldn't try to throw the remote at the TV…!?&quot;
💚&quot;And what the hell's that 'I am Takamine' about…? Why's that guy yelling my name on prime-time national television?&quot;
💚&quot;Why's that guy yelling my name on prime-time national television? Don't get me involved with this. Makes me wanna die…&quot;
💙&quot;fufufu. this is a [national debut], isn't it, midori~&quot;
🖤&quot;I thought we'd already made our national debut as idols a long time ago, though?&quot;
💚&quot;He really only ever does unnecessary things. Now I'll have more things to deal with…&quot;
💛&quot;Things to deal with? …Mm? What're you checking on your phone?&quot;
💚&quot;Mm? I'm just going through different forms of contact and social media, and blocking all of Morisawa-senpai's accounts.&quot;
💛&quot;…Mm? Midori-kun, what are you checking on your phone?&quot;
💚&quot;Mm? I'm just going through different forms of contact and social media, and blocking all of Morisawa-senpai's accounts, is all.&quot;
💛&quot;That would have Morisawa-dono in tears if he knew.&quot;
💛&quot;Not to mention, didn't you block his number too, Midori-kun?&quot;
💙&quot;uu~… because of that, chiaki comes to me to relay every one of his messages as a [mediator], and it is such a [bother], so i would much rather it stops.&quot;
🖤&quot;We gathered in the common room to cheer Morisawa-senpai on, remember? Midori-kun's meant to be cheerin' him on too, so what's the point in blockin' him? Well, I understand how ya feel, though.&quot;
💚&quot;Woah, you understand…&quot;
💚&quot;Huh—…!?&quot;
🖤&quot;…? What's up, Midori-kun?&quot;
💚&quot;He's singing a weird song, and the dance looks really gross… I thought for sure he'd be getting slandered online, so I tried looking it up…&quot;
🖤&quot;He really looks up 'Morisawa Chiaki' immediately…&quot;
🖤&quot;He really looks up 'Morisawa Chiaki' immediately…&quot;
💚&quot;Okay, yeah, I do… But I mean, it's fine, isn't it? That guy always instantly neglects keeping contact when he has a long-term job, for one thing. Someone needs to monitor him, right…?&quot;
💛&quot;If that's what you say, then it's really puzzling why you block him. Your words and actions are entirely contradicting each other.&quot;
💙&quot;this must be what you call a [tsundere], yes~?&quot;
💛&quot;I feel as though there's nothing but the 'tsun', though…?&quot;
💛&quot;Ermm… What happened after that? What did you see after looking up Morisawa-dono?&quot;
💚&quot;It looks like this weird song is going viral on a massive scale on social media… It's number 1 on the trending page. It seems fans are also uploading videos of themselves singing the song.&quot;
💚&quot;It looks like this weird song is going viral on a massive scale on social media… It's number 1 on the trending page. And it seems that fans are also uploading videos of themselves singing the song.&quot;
🖤&quot;…Oh hey, you're right. Looks like they find it super funny.&quot;
💚&quot;But it's like, 'what's the point of going viral through something like this'… This is an audition, so he needs to go viral through the meals being judged. Well, I can't say it's not like Morisawa-senpai to end up like this, though…&quot;
🦢&quot;Feels like Ryuseitai's pretty chill about all of this…? You aren't worried or anxious by the possibility of Morisawa-senpai losing in the audition?&quot;
💚&quot;Won't he be fine? He looked like he was on the brink of death yesterday, but it seems like he got it all shaken off, so?&quot;
🍞&quot;Um, if I remember correctly, the current Ryuseitai changes leaders depending on the work, right?&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah. If it's a ninja-related job, then Sengoku would be leader, and if it's a cooking show that uses vegetables, then Takamine would be leader.&quot;
❤️&quot;I especially recommend the—… Uuu… S-Sorry. It seems I was still a little unprepared. Please give me a bit of time…!

WILDLAND
(19, complete)
❤️&quot;But on the other hand, I feel like it got a little closer to Ryuseitai's image…!&quot;
💚&quot;Did it really? I don't remember the wild route being much of a selling point for us.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ryuseitai's been powered up on a massive scale, and is currently at its most vigorous state. If you consider that to be the reason why they came to us for this project, it makes a lot more sense, don't you think!?&quot;
💚&quot;Mm~ I feel like you're stretching it way too far though…?&quot;
💚&quot;Actually, you were just agonizing over whether or not to participate in the audition until recently—Seeing you hesitate all over again is actually just getting on my nerves instead.&quot;
💛&quot;Now, now, settle down, Midori-kun.&quot;
❤️&quot;…You're right. Mhm, you can count on me! I'm going to make Ryuseitai's name known to the whole world through this audition!
UOOOOHH!! All of this has suddenly gotten me fired up nowww!! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;It's suffocating enough as is, don't start yelling too.&quot;
💛&quot;We haven't closed any cases yet, Shinkai-dono. We were supposed to discuss who will be the commander for WILDLAND.&quot;
💚&quot;It's 'cause Morisawa-senpai got us all side-tracked. Such a hindrance…&quot;
❤️&quot;Hahaha! You say that, but I know you're thinking about me, Takamine~♪&quot;
💙&quot;what splendid vegetables, coming in all colors~♪&quot;
💛&quot;Let's be friends with even the eggplants you can't stand~♪&quot;
💚&quot;……&quot;
💛&quot;M-Midori-kun…Please don't glare so intensely.&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? Ah—Sorry… Was I glaring?&quot;
💛&quot;Mhm, almost like you were looking at your most detested enemy…&quot;
💛&quot;Mhm, almost as if you were looking at your most detested enemy… I regret thoughtlessly humming the tune.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm sorry… You didn't do anything wrong, Shinobu-kun… The only one at fault here is Morisawa-senpai, who made that weird song and dragged me into it.&quot;
💚&quot;The only one at fault here is Morisawa-senpai, who made that weird song and dragged me into it. Tetora-kun may have told him to go right in for the strike, but there's no way he meant it like this, right?&quot;
🖤&quot;……&quot;
💚&quot;Tetora-kun? What's wrong?&quot;
💚&quot;And seriously, I'm on edge as is 'cause of what Morisawa-senpai did—I'm only gonna feel even more irritated if Tetora-kun starts getting worried over stuff right next to me…&quot;
🖤&quot;Ah—I think that's his actual reason! I feel like I wasted my time feeling moved for a sec there!&quot;
💛&quot;As the opening unit for WILDLAND, let's put all our energy into practice!&quot;
💚&quot;I'm not really that up for this, though. That suffocating guy is coming back soon, too.&quot;
💛&quot;Morisawa-dono, correct? Indeed, when was he planning to arrive here?&quot;
💙&quot;he said that he will [join] us in the afternoon~ he seemed to be looking forward to the [practice session] with ryuseitai after so long.&quot;
💚&quot;I'm not looking forward to it at all, though…&quot;
💙&quot;midori really is not [honest], is he~♪&quot;
❤️&quot;We rented this car for safety, it'd be pointless if we end up failing to protect ourselves.&quot;
💚&quot;Uh, if you're gonna say that, then there's someone else you should be scolding right now, y'know.&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm, but he looked like he'd made up his mind. I doubt I could've stopped him.&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh, I know! After I drive a bit more, how about you and I switch places!?&quot;
💚&quot;You, stay quiet please! It's only complicating the conversation…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Hahaha, it's been a while since Takamine's been this harsh with me. I now truly feel like I've come back to Ryuseitai…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;I'm so glad this is ending on a good note. Of course, we can't keep our guard down until we're back, though.&quot;
💚&quot;Seriously… But I'm glad to know the staff are safe.&quot;
❤️&quot;Yeah, definitely. With this, we've accomplished our duty as heroes…♪&quot;
❤️&quot;In that case, I'll be the one to act as a decoy… While I've got the lion distracted, you all get Nagumo into the car.&quot;
💚&quot;Are you an idiot!? That'd only make you the one in hot water this time!&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhaha! We sure got chewed out by the staff, huh!&quot;
💚&quot;Of course we did. And why do you look so happy being told off, anyway…&quot;
💚&quot;Why do you look so happy being told off…&quot;
❤️&quot;Mm. Getting told off for misbehavior suddenly reminded me of my Yumenosaki Academy days. I used to be reckless and get reprimanded by Kunugi-sensei a lot in the past…♪&quot;
💚&quot;No, seriously, why do you look so happy saying that…?&quot;
❤️&quot;But the most unexpected one was Takamine. I didn't think he'd go meet the lion by himself. I could've sworn he said that he didn't want to see any lions for now…&quot;
Mini talks
❤️&quot;We have to take careful action, or we'll just frighten the cat. Mm~ This somehow feels similar to the feeling I get when I strike up a conversation with Takamine.
Er, actually, he'll just get angry with me if I group him with a cat. Anzu, please keep what I said a secret!&quot;

Mini talks
❤️&quot;Heeey, Anzu! Have you seen Takamine anywhere!? He couldn't accept the fact that we've been locked up in Mega Sphere, and ran off.
I only had my eyes off of him for a second… Where could he have gone?&quot;
❤️&quot;He isn't here, either… Are we looking in all the wrong places?
—Ah! This is Takamine we're talking about, so hasn't he actually gone back to the Star House? Why didn't I think of that…! If I just considered Takamine's nature, I would've realized that immediately!&quot;

🥞&quot;Before Takamine-kun came here, did Moricchi give you any advice as your unit leader?&quot;

💚&quot;Sorry, that's my phone. Let me check the number. It might be a spam call…

💚&quot;I've already got the Feature Live to worry about, I don't have the time to deal with you too, Morisawa-senpai. …But I apologize for making you worry.
Well, you talked to me now, so you're satisfied, right? Now please go home.&quot;
💚&quot;Well you talked to me, so you're satisfied, right? Now please go home.&quot;
❤️&quot;Fuhaha! Don't say that! We haven't seen each other in a while so let's talk, Takamine! ☆&quot;
💚&quot;Uwah… I haven't felt this suffocating air in a while… Just when I was starting to feel a bit better too…&quot;
💚&quot;I completely forgot about my Feature Live, but I got brought right back to reality…&quot;
❤️&quot;Oh yeah, you've been thinking of an idea for the live show, right? If there's anything I can help with, feel free to talk to me about it!&quot;
❤️&quot;I can't really meddle by suggesting a specific idea on the sort of stage you should have…&quot;
💚&quot;That's the part I've been most worried about, though…&quot;
❤️&quot;This is your own solo live, Takamine. I don't believe that what your fans want to see is a stage that I think up for you.&quot;
❤️&quot;But don't worry. No matter how the live show turns out, as long as it's a stage you thought up, it'll surely be something incredible!&quot;
💚&quot;…You say it like it's so simple, but don't you ever think about possibly making a mistake…?&quot;
💚&quot;I… don't wanna disappoint my fans who've been supporting me.&quot;
❤️&quot;…It's only natural you'd be anxious about that, Takamine. But I'm sure that all your fans understand that you're doing the best you possibly can to perform on stage, even though you're feeling anxious inside.&quot;
❤️&quot;Your courage to stand on stage and perform with all your might will definitely reach every one of them, Takamine.&quot;
❤️&quot;Of course, the less mistakes, the better, but! The only way for us idols to avoid that is to keep practicing. You're the only one who'll stand on the actual stage, but I can help you out with practice anytime, Takamine!&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah—Would it be easier for you to practice with people your own age instead, like Sengoku or Nagumo…?&quot;
💚&quot;You've been pushy this whole time, so please don't just back out all of a sudden… It throws me off.  …But, right. Morisawa-senpai has always been that sort of person.&quot;
A Wan-derful Misunderstanding
(2, complete)
💚&quot;If only Morisawa-senpai was also there, at the very least… 'Cause whenever there's someone who's more terrified than me around, it calms me down instead…
But that guy's never around the moment I actually want him to be.&quot;
💚&quot;Whenever there's someone who's more terrified than me around, it calms me down instead… But that guy's never around the moment I actually want him to be.
If Morisawa-senpai was there, he probably would've collapsed at the sight of that bright red lump of meat at the end.&quot;
Birthday

❤️&quot;Fuhahahaha! Takamine, happy birthday!&quot;
💚&quot;Ugh—S-Stay away from me…!&quot;
❤️&quot;What's up, what's wrong? Why're you stepping away from me? That'll make me feel lonely, Takamine…!&quot;
💚&quot;You hugged Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun on their birthdays, didn't you…? I've been dreading the day you'd do the same to me…&quot;
❤️&quot;Ohhh, I get it now! You wanted me to hug you, didn't you? I'm sorry for not noticing sooner! Well then, here I go—squeeeze~♪&quot;
💚&quot;No, I'm trying to say the opposite here—Ahhh, jeez, you're so suffocating…!&quot;
❤️&quot;Hm? Oh, is that you over there, Takamine!? I knew you'd come to my birthday party! Why didn't you tell me that you were around? ♪&quot;
💚&quot;'Cause I knew this'd happen… Sigh, I knew I shouldn't have come…&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't be that way! I'm happy to see you here, y'know!&quot;
💚&quot;Ughhh, please don't yell near my ear…&quot;
❤️&quot;Aaalright, Takamine! Now that the five of us are all here, let's take a photo together to commemorate!&quot;
💚&quot;Ehhhh…? Jeez, fine… It is your birthday today, so I'll go along with it. Happy birthday, Morisawa-senpai…♪&quot;
💚&quot;Huh? The screen went dark… Wh—M-Morisawa-senpai? What's going on!? Hey, wait! You're too loud and close to the screen!
Ehhh… Now people are yelling in the background that Morisawa-senpai started the video too early…
Ahh, you guys wanted to tell me happy birthday together?&quot;
❤️&quot;…♪ All this dribbling reminds me of the days I'd play basketball with Akehoshi, Isara, and Takamine.&quot;
💚&quot;…Um, is it just me, or does Morisawa-senpai have tears in his eyes…? …You're getting emotional 'cause of how much I've grown…?
Uu, this is super embarrassing somehow… Never mind, I'm ending my speech here… I forgot everything I wanted to say 'cause of Morisawa-senpai.&quot;
💚&quot;…But… I should be grateful that there are people who're happy to see me grow, shouldn't I?
I'll keep working hard on improving myself, as both an ally and a rival… So I hope we can continue supporting each other.&quot;
❤️&quot;Ah, there he is! Heeey, Takamine~!! ☆ Are you eating well~!?&quot;
💚&quot;Uuu… This is so embarrassing, I just had to have the main lead of the party yell out for me, and then start getting insanely worried over me in front of everybody… He's so insensitive…&quot;
💚&quot;Uuu… This is so embarrassing, I just had to have the main lead of the party yell out for me, and then start getting insanely worried over me in front of everybody… He's so insensitive…&quot;
🎸&quot;Aw c'mon, it just means that you're getting doted on by Morisawa-senpai, right?&quot;
❤️&quot;Isara, you were with Takamine!? I assure you that you're both my adorable juniors! C'mere~! ☆&quot;
🎸&quot;Ahaha, you always hug as soon as you can, huh?&quot;
💚&quot;Meh, I'll go along with it for today… Since you just love to goof off with your juniors no matter how old you get…&quot;
💚&quot;Haah, it's finally over… It's waaay easier celebrating someone else's birthday over your own. I'm really just not made to be the main role of anything…&quot;
🎀&quot;You're always the main role.&quot;
💚&quot;Ahaha… You almost sounded like Morisawa-senpai there.&quot;
❤️&quot;Heheh, I heard all kinds of things about the birthday event! I've actually already prepared a video for Takamine's bir—
Ah—!!  ……Whew, Takamine isn't around. I have to make sure I don't spoil the surprise before his birthday.&quot;
❤️&quot;Strengthen your justice power with this!&quot;
💚&quot;What the heck is 'justice power'?&quot;
💚&quot;I mean… I'm always indebted to you, so…&quot;
❤️&quot;Thank you, Takamine! I wonder what's inside your present!?&quot;

❤️&quot;It means that your hard work is paying off! Let's continue to work hard and make more of our fans happy!&quot;
💚&quot;Ahh, no wonder why it suddenly felt suffocating in here; it was you, Morisawa-senpai… Do you have business with me or something?&quot;
❤️&quot;Don't be so shy, Takamine! You seem to have some free time now, so I thought it'd be good to have a little chat with you!&quot;
❤️&quot;Takamine, you're in a unique position as both a greengrocer and an idol, right? That makes me excited to see how you'll grow from here on~♪&quot;

❤️&quot;Takamine, how does it feel to be a senior~!? Isn't it so nice to have juniors who adore you!?&quot;
💚&quot;N-Not really. I don't really feel anything in particular, since I'm pretty shy… But I do wanna try and get along with them.&quot;

    <title>Answered Question: About Chiaki’s ‘Takamine-kun’ line in Sweet Halloween</title>
    <url>//20240822_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
hey…. diff anon piggybacking off of the ask about chiakis changes in tone over the years. you said that theres multiple implications over chiakis tone change in the &quot;takamine-kun&quot; line… do you mind me asking what those implications are? the little worm inside my brain that loves chiaki has its interests peaked

Sent and answered in August 2024. tweet link of the answer

WAH… DIDN’T EXPECT SOMEONE TO BE INTERESTED
To be honest, I need to confirm with a native Japanese speaker about ALL the implications BUT I’ll explain my thought process and possible implications.
This is a continuation of what I said in the answer already, so for any missing context, it might have already been covered in there. The ask and the answer here.
So this part about Chiaki is notable about him in general, rather than specifically the difference between 1st/2nd year Chiaki and current Chiaki.
I’ll just copy paste what I said real quick:

There are a few moments here and there when Chiaki words himself in a more meek or unsure manner and starts speaking more politely (when he gets scared that there’s a ghost in 1st year Chapter 1, when Kuro first appears and freaks him out in Chapter 5). He still does this sort of thing nowadays when he gets scared, happens as recent as VS Gourmet, Praise of Delicious Flavors 9 (cute).
Sweet halloween is the one that did this a LITTLE differently where he kinda talks more casually and plainly to express politeness. It’s mainly in let’s party 2, the &quot;Takamine-kun&quot; line. I think, because he’s talking to Midori (someone younger than him), he shows that politeness by AVOIDING talking in a rough/informal manner, rather than showing it through wording himself in an OVERLY polite manner (which is how you would speak to someone older than or above you, and that doesn’t work here when Midori is younger than him)…

As I said, there’s a lot more implications to this than what I wrote above. On one hand, it’s likely that the reason he talks to Midori like this is to express politeness to someone younger (Using &quot;Takamine-kun&quot; and asking nicely), but there is another implication to it.
Chiaki’s typical way of speaking can make him sound more confident or bold due to the masculine tone. So when Chiaki speaks a lot more plainly, the sudden lack of masculine tone gives off the feeling of a vulnerable or &quot;unadulterated&quot; side of him, or just not as confident of himself.
For example, Chiaki typically says suman, sumanai, or gomen na to apologize, all of which sound masculine. So when he uses gomen instead, it sounds less &quot;bold&quot; in comparison. (Note, the na is what gives off the masculine feel)
This sort of thing is what stands out about the Sweet Halloween scene. First, let’s break down the scene a bit. Chiaki says:

eh? ta-takamine? takamine-kun, kyodai na gankyuu o oshitsukeru no wa yametekureru?
jibun-tachi de tsukutta kara kazari no nisemono datte wakatteru kedo, yappari gurokute kimochi warui!


Wh—!? T-Takamine? Takamine-kun, could you please not shove that giant eyeball in my face…?
We made them ourselves, so I know it’s fake and all, but it’s seriously creepy-looking…!

The bolded parts are the parts that make you think &quot;Wait, that’s not the typical way Chiaki speaks&quot;. If it were the usual Chiaki with his masculine way of speaking, he’d have said it like this:

eh? ta-takamine? takamine, kyodai na gankyuu o oshitsukeru no wa yametekurenai ka?
jibun-tachi de tsukutta kara kazari no nisemono datte wakatteru ga, yappari gurokute kimochi warui zo!

(Last part with kimochi warui is debatable to be honest, he could still say it as is, without the added zo, but I think it’d have been way more typical Chiaki to add a zo or na at the end)
So first, there’s a change in how he calls Midori, then he switches to a plain non-masculine tone to politely ask Midori to stop, then he uses kedo for &quot;but&quot; instead of ga (which fits the masculine tone. And if Chiaki ever uses kedo, it’s with na at the end of the sentence, like kedo na), and then ends it with a plain kimochi warui
I neglected to mention that this has happened before in two occasions, Meteor Impact and VS GOURMET. EXCEPT!!! Unlike in Sweet Halloween, he was just talking to himself while freaking out AND it still sounds a bit different from the above case, since again, he was also trying to ask Midori in a politer way to stop.
In Meteor Impact 1st year Chapter 1, right at the start:

(…kowai! hisshi ni kakkoii koto o itte onore o kobu shitemita kedo mou muri! kaeritai~!)


(…It’s too scary! I’m trying so hard to encourage myself with super cool catchphrases, but I can’t take this anymore! I wanna go home~!!)

The bolded part sounds childish, I tried to show this by making him say &quot;I wanna go home~!&quot;. But to be fair, it makes sense for Chiaki to sound innocent and vulnerable during his 1st year days.
Then we have VS GOURMET Praise of Delicious Flavors 9, when Mayoi starts mumbling:

eh. futsuu ni kowai!
genchou to iu koto ni shite kizukanakatta koto ni shitai ga… mi ni ikanakya dame kanaa!?


Huh!? This is just freaky!
I really just want to pretend I didn’t notice it and wave it off as a hallucination, but… Do I have to go and see what it is~!?

The futsuu ni kowai! is a very… unfiltered? way to express it, it almost sounds teenager-like. Here, he actually DOES use one typical masculine way of speaking, the ga (&quot;but&quot;), but then immediately speaks extremely casually again at the very end. I tried to show this with the italics and Chiaki expressing his fear in a more casual way with him saying &quot;just freaky!&quot;. The moment he realizes it’s Mayoi he goes back to speaking his usual way.
So, these are my own personal interpretation and speculations, but here are the things I find interesting about all of this:


It’s likely that this is a very unfiltered Chiaki. He’s so freaked out that he can’t even respond in his usual way… if that makes sense.


It’s possible this is related to how Chiaki used to speak as a kid, since it’s much more plain. It also sounds a bit more childish from the sudden loss of ANY masculine/bold tone, so while it feels more or less natural to hear 1st year Chiaki freak out like that, Chiaki still reacting in that tone at age 18-19 feels &quot;oh…?&quot;


The main ways we’ve seen it is either Chiaki being freaked out by something scaring him, or Midori freaking Chiaki out. In all these years of content and story, Midori is still the only person who deliberately spooked Chiaki so hard that it brought out this different, unfiltered side of him in response. Very fitting for Midori’s role in Chiaki’s life. Heh.


As mentioned in my previous ask, when Chiaki gets spooked he starts speaking politely, typically towards the ghost that’s freaking him out (&quot;I’m so sorry! Please don’t curse me!&quot;). But in these cases, he’s speaking casually and plainly. So it’s interesting that Chiaki’s speaking to Midori in that tone. It’s almost like Chiaki is speaking to Midori on the same level (not as someone older than him, and neither as if Midori is above him). And I must emphasize… Midori deliberately tried to scare him here, so Midori himself brought this side of Chiaki out with his actions. (Very Important) (Very Relevant To Their Relationship)


All in all, just a very interesting thing about Chiaki that’s fun to take note of as we get to see more of this unfiltered side of him!!
The main thing I’m not sure of is if I’m overreaching a little TOO much. To be clear, it IS significant and I see JP ChiakiP comment on it all the time whenever Chiaki does this (that Sweet Halloween line in particular is still very famous for the sudden Takamine-kun and used often in fanworks under similar &quot;Midori scaring Chiaki&quot; situations, and the recent Gourmet scenes had ChiakiP go &quot;he’s talking plainly here it feels unfiltered and cute&quot;), but it may not be significant in the way that I’m personally thinking. So it’d be nice to just get a full confirmation by having a discussion about it with a JP native speaker (tempted to get a JP lesson with a teacher about this… anything for Him)
Some notes:


Chiaki does occasionally use kedo (without the na) to say &quot;but&quot;, but very sparsely or because it grammatically fits better. Otherwise, he typically says kedo na or ga.


Chiaki’s spiral towards Subaru in Meteor Impact also contains a bit of that &quot;sounding more vulnerable in his tone&quot;, but it’s in an entirely different way from how he speaks when he gets spooked. It’s more that his tone also shows how emotionally distraught and unfiltered he is at that moment.


If I have more to add, I’ll edit this post in and mention an update on the tweet. Thank you for asking, I got so into it because I just love Chiaki so much!! Let me know if anything was unclear or if you have other questions.

    <title>Answered Question: Meteor Impact Anime Prediction</title>
    <url>//20240822_2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
do you think they would announce meteor impact anime late september during the second half anni tsukisuta :00 i really feel that mi is next given the way they didnt announce any remini anime back in april!  its very suspicious… like it would definitely make sense that they didnt announce it cause mi is the longest out of the remini stories so they possibly cannot cover it in six episodes each only about ten minutes, so theyre probably needing more time to work on it or something. what are your thoughts on it!

Sent and answered in August 2024. tweet link of the answer

honestly don't know, i might start having those thoughts if one of the ryuseitai seiyuus are announced to be in the half anniversary stream, since that's how they announced checkmate last year. but i agree that it's soooo sus how there's a huge gap between the last anime and the next one… either the timing of the event content post-anime isn't right just yet, or it's because of meteor impact's length or… a mixture of the two or we're just overthinking it WHO KNOWS… THE WAIT IS SO MYSTERIOUS!!!
my thoughts are about the same as yours…!!! one extra thing on my mind is that when stella came out and it was revealed to be THE meteor impact answer for kanata (basically finally explaining so much about him and why he was like that in the past and a chance for him to be a hero), i was like &quot;oh… oh wait then this means we need an answer for chiaki's side of meteor impact right??? he's the other 5* his story is important too!!&quot;
so i started to think that it's SUUUPER likely that meteor impact anime will be connected to chiaki's center, rather than a special tour. especially since i strongly believe chiaki's next center will bring back megane chiaki, and the last time we saw megane chiaki (as a card) is in meteor impact so &quot;it makes sense trust me bro&quot;
BUT THEN!!! gourmet ended up being THE meteor impact answer for chiaki!! so now we're back to a special tour being way more likely, since the next person in line that needs his meteor impact answer is… madara!! but he was a 4* unlike the other 2 so i can't imagine it being meteor impact anime -&gt; mam event and nothing else HAHA chiaki and kanata were THE 5*s after all… so… special tour very likely…? considering there's still a lot to work out between these three, plus tetora's established connection with madara…?
still unclear but… i'm leaning towards that now ever since gourmet came out!! so that's all that's on my mind lately for meteor impact anime LMAO &quot;what is the mysterious event they'll release right after it. TELL ME NOW!!!!&quot;
(also to be clear i Still think chiaki center will be the megane chiaki comeback card. i will never let this go until proven wrong)

    <title>Answered Question: Jin and Chiaki</title>
    <url>//20240822_3/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
You talk about Jin and Chiakis dynamic a lot I love reading about it &amp; chiaki in general! I find Jin's role as ryusei rainbow so interesting because he's all the colors, very fitting for a solo idol with no one by his side, I feel like it fits well with ryuseitais arc

Sent and answered in August 2024. tweet link of the answer

i'm glad 🥺❤️ i love chiaki's dynamic with jin and how important their teacher-student relationship is uuu… rainbow loops in my mind so much. it's so important… also fanboy chiaki is the funniest shit ever
but gosh you're so right damn… it's truly the perfect metaphor of jin's era, where he was the only super idol and how that started to burden him … shown in his ryusei color too, being ALL colors at once, being the most well-known hero at the time (both akiomi and chiaki remember it well even though jin considers it as only having been a helping role)… like ugh!! i didn't think about it until now and it's so true anon wtf!!!!
there was something similar with ryusei purple (madara), and then madara's wish got split between two people, red chiaki and blue kanata… but then chiaki accidentally over burdened himself with the traditions of the red color, something that was too heavy for one person to handle (tetora couldn't handle it either)… until ryuseitai re-defined what red means in the unit, allowing chiaki to be the color he loves rather than the burdens of the color!! shown in this chart (sorry i always find an opportunity to link it it's So good)
now ryuseitai properly split the &quot;rainbow colors&quot; between all 5 people, all supporting each other and being by each other's sides 🥺🥺 with the purple color of the rainbow being the unit's color in general now… uweh…it's too good. so many essays could be made out of this. i love them. ryusei rainbow the world chiaki and akiomi are so right to make a big deal out of it

    <title>Answered Question: Pre-!! Era Days</title>
    <url>//20240824_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Hey hey, I was wondering: when !! Wasn’t a thing and players didn’t know what was going to happen with the game and story, were you there to live it? What were your thoughts about Ryuseitai’s story and Midochia content?

Sent and answered in August 2024. tweet link of the answer

yess i was! i came into the fandom late 2016 so i experienced a bunch of stuff
i’m trying so hard to remember when they announced the ! era to !! era advancement, but i can’t exactly remember nor find the exact date/time… i looked into my archives and the earliest i could find of me talking about it is april 2019, since that’s when operetta came out…? but then i also found me discussing it in a &quot;wait it’s really happening??&quot; way in august 2019, so maybe that’s when they made it clearer that it’s a permanent switch-over GAHH been too long to remember…
it doesn’t help that my memory is getting foggier since it’s been so long now, thankfully i do have tweet archives of those days so i can jog my memory with them
with that being said, is there something specific you’re curious to know? like what my vision of ryuseitai’s future was before we even knew !! era was gonna be a thing? or is it my thoughts about the timeline advancing? it might make it easier for me to recount my memories if it’s something a bit more specific since even back then, my whole life was ryuseitai…!! LMAO
midochia is a bit easier though so i’ll answer that at least! midochia content back then was mainly The Big Three (climax, sweet halloween, and zodiac. a tinsy bit of strawberry picking too) with a bunch of stuff in between being cute fun content for them (birthday, orihime and hikoboshi, stuff like that). i used to be a chiaki multishipper back then with midochia being one of my top ships, but i’d mainly consume the fanworks rather than make my own ideas… especially because the fandom would come up with the most amazing ideas just through The Big Three so i felt content just consuming the fanworks…
and gosh back then, the post-grad midochia ideas were endless… it was such a fun part of them to explore, how chiaki would work solo post-grad (while living in an apartment alone) while midori is still in school and tries to stay connected with him despite the distance. you still see ideas like this sometimes but obviously not as much anymore. I STILL LOVE THEM SOOOO MUCH since it was based off of the potential of climax midori and his desire to repay him ueeeh i’m weak…
midochia was my Very Cute And Super Fun Ship, and was one of the potential endgames i thought was perfect for chiaki because i really loved everything midori offered for chiaki and vice versa… they were always so fun to dissect since it was mainly about digesting The Big Three for their relationship, ALL OF WHICH WERE SUCH AMAZING STORIES TO GO BACK ON OVER AND OVER!! i went from &quot;wow midochia is funn and cute&quot; when i first got into enstars to &quot;UWEEEEH MIDOCHIA… SO CUTE SO CUTE LOVE LOVE… I LOVE WHAT I SEE FOR THEM&quot; in 2018 (thanks to The Big Three)
then meteor impact happens in 2019 and i start to hardcore ship midochia as The Chiaki Endgame because i was like &quot;MIDORI. IT HAS TO BE YOU WHO SAVES CHIAKI. PLEASE&quot; and i’ve never gone back since. and then !! era rewarded me for being desperate and now i’m definitely loyal for life.
i feel like i didn’t answer the question properly though, so yeah if there’s anything specific you were hoping to know, feel free to ask!!! my thoughts about ryuseitai and midochia were definitely a lot different than the thoughts i started having of them when !! era started though so there is a Lot i can say, but also a little too much that i don’t even know what to narrow down to AHH…

    <title>Answered Question: About Ryuseitai’s Different Forms of Justice</title>
    <url>//20240824_2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
After learning about Chiaki and Tetora, im curious to know how you would qualify Midori’s and Kanata’s perception of justice according to what we’ve seen in Tropical and Stella Maris ?
And with Shinobu’s potential center looming over the horizon, any theory about his vision of justice ?

Sent and answered in August 2024. tweet link of the answer

sure!! i talked about this before in an ask but it was just after stella maris ended so i was still digesting a lot of my thoughts at the time… so here’s a version that’s a little more complete! i’ll also mention tetora’s to complete the picture. time for a rundown of reborn ryuseitai, my favorite topic in the whole world!!!!
RB (tetora)
story is supervillain. came to life by fighting against an actual evil in reality that was causing harm to people. a lot of it is because tetora wanted to be worth something, and to actually put in effort in something all the way. he also wanted to save his juniors and get them out of such a dangerous organization. the theme is &quot;evil is justice too&quot;
RB has a lot to do with paving a new pathway of justice in something that isn’t typically regarded as such (in this case, evil). and by doing so, tetora proves that justice can be achieved in all kinds of forms! he validates ALL forms of justice. it doesn’t have to be in the traditional ideal hero way at all.
what i love about RB as well is that it supports ryuseitai’s principles. take for example ryusei hanabi’s &quot;if you pray for the peace of the world, then even yesterday’s enemies are members&quot; line. i feel like RB perfectly represents that concept and proves it to be true, since they are &quot;heroes who were dyed in evil&quot;!! and i specifically mean ryuseitai rather than tokusatsu principles, since !! era ryuseitai is a lot about breaking free from the chains of tradition but still remaining as who they are and what they believe in. it really suits tetora, the person who has always taken ryuseitai’s mottos to heart (he constantly says how much he believes in the &quot;all for one and one for all&quot; phrase)…
there’s a chance RB will take on new forms and shapes the next time we see it, since it spontaneously came to life at the time, but for now! this is the gist of what makes it so good.
RG (midori)
story is tropical. there are no such thing as enemies here. it’s all about being yourself and loving what you love. midori focuses a lot on creating a space where everyone, including ryuseitai, can relax (after all, there are no enemies to fight in the first place). performed specifically for the sake of saving his beloved mascots who comforted him for many years, BUT… he hesitated at first to bring his ryuseitai to life because he had a lot of anxiety that he may not be good enough as a leader, and that he may end up harming ryuseitai’s image with his own likes (with his individuality)… but the support he gets from ryuseitai and anzu, and finding out he has a chance to save his beloved mascots, gives him enough courage to try and form his own ryuseitai and show what he’s capable of.
yuruseitai is unconventionally heroic. it’s heroic in its essence (believing in something and standing your ground for what you believe in) but not in its shape (there are no enemies to fight, no justice vs evil). it perfectly fits midori and how he doesn’t care at all for tokusatsu’s hero values and other traditionally hero things. midori as a person tends to be pretty pessimistically pragmatic, yet his ideal &quot;hero&quot; vision is a world where nobody struggles at all and can just be themselves… it’s so precious?? and since the song focuses so much on being yourself, untied by any conventions or expectations, it’s the perfect answer and sequel to !! era ryuseitai’s arc 🥺 reading tropical after watching relax paradise gives the impression that midori specifically wants this to be a relaxing place for his precious comrades the most above all… not to mention its strong focus on being so goofy and silly and embracing that!!
the theme is &quot;it’s okay to be you&quot;. i think there’s an even better way to word the theme of his unit, but it’s not coming to me right now… but!! definitely about being true to yourself! even at the end of the story, he reminds chiaki (who was trying way too hard to be &quot;soft&quot; like a yuruchara) that yuruseitai isn’t about literally being a yuruchara, it’s just about relaxing and taking it easy!!
RC (kanata)
story is stella maris. after kanata rejected being a leader many times, his ryuseitai finally came to be due to his wish to repay everyone around him, since it’s thanks to them that he’s here. focuses on saving a boy who looked exactly like his young self, along with the island he’s from (hoshijima). he wanted to make others experience the happiness he received from everyone. the theme is &quot;a cycle of happiness&quot;
fish ryuseitai encourages an endless cycle of love and kindness. repaying kindness with kindness, love with love, until it spreads across the whole world and now everyone is smiling together… and that’s how people’s fears and anxieties about life, their future, their situation etc fade away. it fits perfectly to kanata’s backstory (the &quot;evil things&quot; that can negatively influence people, and can only be purified by someone like kanata). it’s taking everything about kanata thus far and reshaping it into his ideal form of justice… it’s so 🥺🥺🥺 especially with abyss in mind, knowing that from day 1 kanata has only ever wanted to dispel &quot;evil&quot;, whether as an ally of justice or god.
one other thing about fish ryuseitai is that kanata’s plan/intention had a lot to do with guidance and leading the way for the hoshijima people, rather than being someone above them, ordering them around or granting things for them. he gives people the space to explore themselves and validates their way of finding their &quot;form of justice&quot;. he gently nudges people towards the direction of what they want… and that’s exactly what kanata had been doing for ryuseitai in !! era (even ! era). he heard their wishes and desires and gently guided them down a path that will fulfill those desires. what’s more! that’s exactly what chiaki told him what dreams are back in meteor impact! it’s such a beautiful convo so i’ll put the important part here:

Kanata: mm~? i don’t understand this anymore! i really can’t help but see Wishes and Dreams as the same! i cannot tell the Difference!
it is Not a dream if all of it is Bestowed on you by someone, right? then, i will make a Compromise with you!
chiaki! please tell me your Wish!
and once you’ve Worked hard for a bit, i will make it possible to Grant it!
…is that wrong, too?


Chiaki: No, not at all. I really appreciate it. I’m happy to hear that you want to support and help me achieve my dream.
But please, don’t use your worshippers just to help me with my dream!
If you’ll help me by yourself — if you’ll lend me a hand ordinarily, then I don’t mind!
That’s how all the people in the whole world make their dreams come true, without ever using the help of some God!
I can’t cheat my way toward it! So please, cheer me on as a friend!

also linking this thread (which i made before the story for stella maris came out, but it’s still really relevant) for more thoughts if you’re curious
one last note is that kanata’s backstory with all the &quot;evil things&quot; (can also be translated as &quot;bad things&quot;) is a different type of &quot;evil&quot; than what tetora’s RB represents. it’s related to people’s anxieties and fears typically being the root cause to &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; acts (for example, in their eyes, they’re defending themselves against something dangerous), and peace and understanding can only come by dispelling those fears. this is also explored in stella maris through the people of hoshijima.

with this in mind, so far we can say that the ryuseitai’s contain these elements:


some kind of inner, selfish wish


an ideal vision that’s grounded in reality


there’s some kind of specific, tangible target for it (whether to fight against or to save)


and this is what leads it to be a unique ryuseitai of its own. the contrasts between the ryuseitais are fascinating and so interesting to look into and i could talk about it forever…
although i discussed chiaki’s form of justice in some tweets… after supervillain, even chiaki’s form of justice has been starting to take a new form slowly but surely. so we’ve yet to truly know RR (chiaki) and RY (shinobu).
RY is a given, but RR will also definitely happen despite chiaki having been a leader for a long time already. this time around, his reborn ryuseitai should reflect who he truly is deep inside, rather than what he believed he had to embody to become a hero (since chiaki’s arc has a lot to do with how heroes never existed in reality, so he had to find a way to make it a reality once and for all, even if it cost him a lot of mental and physical energy).
THAT BEING SAID! we at least do know that chiaki’s ryuseitai still includes hero shows and typical tokusatsu concepts like it always has. this is shown in parallel world (a story set after supervillain, where chiaki gets to be the leader because they have to perform a hero show. HIS WHOLE SPECIALTY!). theoretically this time around what will be different is it 1: reflects and represents who he really is deep down, 2: is not constrained to traditional values just because &quot;that’s how it’s done in tokusatsu&quot;, aaand probably some other things too
as for RY… i’ll be combining other answers i posted in the past for this part, but! akira has been telling us a lot about unmasked shinobu (i.e. doesn’t use ninja speech, uses &quot;boku&quot; instead of &quot;sessha&quot; for first-person pronoun) in various stories and reminding us that ninja is not the only part that makes shinobu… and in terms of his center, they can’t do Yet Another Ninja Song for him, soo… lots of new territory for shinobu!!
also, akira has been indirectly building up an arc for shinobu where he goes through a LOT of trials related to trust (mostly from yuuta, but it was shown in ryuseitai stories like supervillain too where chiaki says he KNOWS shinobu would never betray ryuseitai), and he’s sort of sombered and matured because of these events (this is shown in stella maris), so i wonder how this would be reflected in the storywriting…
even if his center isn’t written by akira, i’m still expecting SOMETHING SUPER NEW FOR SHINOBU TO SHOW HIS RYUSEITAI!! his fs2 moved away from his ninja theme, and i imagine his center will also do something similar.
as for his vision of justice, that’s a bit tricky for me to pin down hmm. here are some points about shinobu that i’ve been keeping in mind for his potential:


shinobu has a relentless spirit where he never wants to leave his friends alone, and he wants to be capable of assisting them no matter what. he also wants to show he's grown and become reliable


as mentioned in dokisuta: &quot;Extremely attentive and capable of calming the atmosphere; he is the Cheerful balancer&quot;, which i think is so relevant to this very day… he also isn't really a big fan (and arguably even sensitive to it) of seeing anyone in ryuseitai argue with each other, even if they're arguing for good reason.


he’s always been about sharing his love with others, and wanting people to know the joy of sharing your interests, that you don’t have to be alone


he tends to be seen as someone to protect or someone who should remain as he is (usually when discussing his &quot;small and cute&quot; self), when in reality shinobu is actually very capable of protecting others and has an extremely relentless mental mind. for example, i can say for SURE that nobody in ryuseitai could’ve done for their close friend what shinobu did for yuuta, which is stay by his side no matter how many times yuuta pushed him away. that’s a unique strength only shinobu has. for example tetora has drowned in his feeling of inadequacy when trying to face his friend (midori), and midori mentally collapses when a close person is mentally not doing well… these are things that shinobu managed to still stand his ground and persist through!


so i assume his ryuseitai will have these sorts of elements, but in a new shape…? but i’m really not sure what to expect at all, it’s all the more why i’m really excited for his center!!! I WANT TO KNOW SO BAD!!!!
lastly, for something i personally find very interesting… midori mentioned all the way back in SS finals (story set in the new year of !! era) that shinobu &quot;is much more qualified as the leader (of ryuseitai)&quot;. THIS WAS WAY BEFORE THEY EVEN DID THE WHOLE ALL-LEADER SYSTEM LOL. another interesting point is that chiaki trusts shinobu with tasks WAAAAY too much, to the point he’s said that &quot;as long as sengoku takes care of it, there’ll be no problems!&quot; (this was in stella maris), whereas shinobu replies that he’d rather not be relied on so much, he’s feeble and could collapse by it. so it seems like there’s this general vibe around shinobu where he’s seen as someone Extremely Capable as a leader and someone to rely on, but at the same time that being something that could potentially put too much burden on him…? how, i don’t know yet… maybe i’m reading into it wrong, but it’s always on my mind, and makes me sooo excited to find out the full story.
all in all, these are just my personal interpretations and thoughts. i love what we're learning about ryuseitai, i love how there's so much to dig into and explore. i love i just love so much… so thank you for asking!!

    <title>Answered Question: Pre-!! Era Days and Fan’s Headcanons</title>
    <url>//20240830_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Yes yes! I want to know what the fandom though that time about ryuseitai’s future before !! even existed, and Yesss I saw the Midochia content from back then and the possibility of Chiaki being a solo idol and Midori being like &quot;I want to see him more 🥺&quot;~ I arrived quite late to the fandom so I’m curious about the thoughts of someone who loves Ryuseitai and Midochia and had the opportunity to live that 👀

Sent and answered in August 2024. a continuation of this curiouscat question. tweet link of the answer

thank you for the clarification!! let’s see then… okay, so note that this is the sort of stuff you would’ve come across mostly pre-meteor impact (april 2019), so from 2015 to late 2018. these still existed in 2019 somewhat but, it’s also when hapiele announced the timeline will potentially advance so it was more like &quot;panic&quot; era LOL (since &quot;oh god everything we’ve known is going to change&quot; was a common thought)
so! headcanons fans would have about ryuseitai’s future were stuff like:


ryusei red tetora, being a leader, being on stage with midori and shinobu by his side, having his own juniors, etc


some kind of &quot;passing on the ryusei red jacket to tetora&quot; special moment between chiaki and tetora post-repayfes, like during graduation or other. i vaguely remember there being a lot of fanart like that whenever it was graduation season


graduation ideas Everywhere and especially when graduation season comes about. stuff like how the juniors would cry as they see off their seniors, chiaki passing on something of his to one of them (like his green tie to midori for example)


&quot;how would tetora, midori, and shinobu act as the senpais for their new members&quot; kind of ideas. tetora being seen as reliable and confident and super cool, midori and shinobu as bashful but do their best, especially to support tetora. also all of them having juniors that go kyaa over how cool and handsome they are. i feel like i vaguely remember an idea that explores the new ryusei black member (a new junior) and tetora talking to that member about his own experiences to encourage him… but maybe i’m making shit up


tetora getting leader advice from chiaki by calling him or meeting up with him. chiaki sharing a part of himself with tetora whenever tetora starts to struggle as a leader. ok actually i can’t remember how many people thought that up, that was just my headcanon


also something that was more my headcanon but it probably did exist in other people’s minds too, but i headcanonned that ryuseitai got a huge load of juniors because they all felt inspired by ryuseitai and wanted to be heroes too, and it was one of the struggles tetora went through at first but overcame with the help and support of midori and shinobu. with chiaki offering to help but tetora tells him it’s ok he’ll figure it out


tetora who’s taller and got ear piercings in his 3rd year, midori who’s grown taller too and even picked up modeling, shinobu who’s still the same height more or less but more handsome


ryuseitai juniors catching up with their ryuseitai seniors in a monthly get-together or something similar to that. or even half-yearly sometimes because chiaki’s usually headcanonned to be very busy with work


chiaki was headcanonned as someone who becomes part of the acting and/or modeling showbiz after graduation, instead of an idol. chiaki appearing in his dream toku shows, in tv shows in general etc and becoming an action star


kanata’s post-grad headcanons ranged from going into showbiz, to not doing anything related to showbiz, to even ideas about kanata disappearing post-grad and people trying to find him again. chiaki sometimes had &quot;disappears after graduation and people try to find him&quot; concepts too though


sometimes chiaki and kanata were headcanonned to live in the same apartment building, but most times it was them living in their own apartments. sometimes also as them partnering up for jobs together because of that &quot;kamen rider no.1 and no.2&quot; chiaki line from climax


most common headcanon was that all of them would no longer see themselves as part of ryuseitai once they graduate. so even when the juniors graduate they see themselves as just having their own careers right now, and that once upon a time they were &quot;ryusei (color)&quot;. but they’d still reference their ryusei color like &quot;i’m the green of compassion after all, even if i’ve graduated/retired from that&quot; kind of thing


ryuseitai doing a small ryuseitai live for nostalgia and as a reunion with their fans and each other. sometimes depicted as when the juniors are still in their 3rd year, but most times it’s set after they’ve graduated and now all adults. i remember sometimes seeing fans dub it &quot;neo ryuseitai&quot; in their fanworks (i headcanonned it with a similar name too)


chiaki always tearing up when he meets them again and sees how much they’ve grown


not sure about tetora and shinobu’s commonly headcanonned post-grad careers (other than &quot;go into showbiz&quot;) but for midori, other than showbiz, another was modelling, and another was him quitting being an idol and inheriting the greengrocer shop


climax set the tone for a lot of these headcanons i listed. sadly, i didn’t explore that many headcanons that existed before climax since i came pretty late into 2016, and climax was released early 2017… but whenever i’d read 2015/2016 midochia fics set in the future, there would be plenty of headcanons about midori’s development and how he’d grow. even pre-climax there were a lot of ideas about how he wants to work hard for ryuseitai, he wants to repay them (especially chiaki) for giving him confidence in himself… stuff like that!!
not THAT related to post-grad headcanons but i may as well share for being such an old beautiful relic… there was even a famous MMD exploring midori’s development just months before climax. i rewatched it now after so long and it’s still soooo sweet, so i’ll share it here with the translation! (which i translated long ago when it first came out, and cleaned it up just now for this ask LOL)
i think there’s a few more but these are the common ones i could remember… it’s pretty interesting to list them now after so long, with all the things we learn in !! era LOL i personally held a LOT of these headcanons too and would daydream a lot about different things to do with their future… it was a very fascinating topic to think about back then… thank you for asking!! let me know if there’s still something else you wanted to know!!

    <title>Answered Question: Reason to Read Non-Oshi Stories</title>
    <url>//20240903_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
i sincerely mean no offense when i ask this, but how come you read so many non-ryuseitai stories? i guess i find it interesting since most (insert character or group)P don’t do that? do you do this because you like connecting ryuseitai to other characters/groups? again i genuinely mean no offense by this, i’m just curious since i’ve noticed most enstars fans don’t like reading stories outside of their interests

Sent and answered in September 2024. tweet link of the answer

short answer: this is an interesting ask to me because the norm for me Is to read enstars stories even if not of my oshi. i don’t always do that but generally i hope to keep reading more and more stuff, especially if it’s a new story
long answer: i had an enstars burnout from 2021 to early 2023 (pre-supervillain) that demotivated me from reading stories outside of my oshis, but otherwise…! my default state is to read enstars stories, especially if they pique my interest LOL it’s what i’ve always done since i came into the fandom. i got through a pretty big chunk of ! era stories just by reading the translations available and then keeping up with released stories
THAT BEING SAID, it’s easy to lose the motivation to keep this up (happened to me with some other mobage), so there are indeed motivating factors that make me keep this up for so many years now. well, save for the burnout, but i grew back the motivation to read in 2023 because of some of the reasons i’m about to list!


on a general basis, i find enstars writing Really Fun and super fascinating to explore. usually akira’s stories pique my interest the most but i enjoy subwriter stories just as much. it just depends on my mood since akira tends to do heavy/dense stories whereas subwriters do lighthearted and fun stories


as an extension to the above, back when writer names were shown i really enjoyed analyzing the different writing styles by each writer and the charm points and downsides of each one, and the only way to do that is to read more. i’ve done it for so many years that i still can’t let go of this habit even after they’ve hidden the names


i get very curious about some characters enough to try picking up some of their stories, and i always get rewarded for doing so by coming out of the stories learning something new about them. so it keeps motivating me to do this over and over again. i also warmed up to certain characters purely because i picked up their stories, which just Feels So Nice to start caring for more parts of enstars so… an endless positive cycle with this one


sort of a different route from the above but sometimes when reading an oshi-centered story, other non-oshi characters get involved and it naturally piques my interest to learn more about them.


the burnout i had during some of the most important !! era lore drops (2021-early 2023) widened my information gap so badly that i could feel how it started to affect my understanding of my own oshis’ lore (ryuseitai, midori/chiaki). i.e. i had a very narrow-minded perspective of the storyline because i just Didn’t Know what’s going on outside of ryuseitai. so as i started closing that gap, i came to realize &quot;OMG WOAH READING OTHER OSHI STORIES REALLY DOES HELP BUILD MY UNDERSTANDING OF RYUSEITAI EVEN MORE….!!!&quot; which gets me motivated to read more stories


as you mentioned, one of the reasons is because it’s fun connecting ryuseitai to other stories. and in fact, ryuseitai really IS connected to quite a handful of non-ryuseitai stories! (fine’s climax atlantis is one, and even early in !! era, there were quite a handful of ryuseitai mentions in switch’s first unit story (magic lantern) of all places. fun). so now i definitely can’t help myself from picking up more and more stories


it’s fun having random trivia of characters retained in my mind because i read that one story for them years ago LOL i still remember quite a handful of stuff i learned about characters from early ! era stories. also thanks to it i can keep up with people’s conversations outside of my oshi. and when i realize i can’t keep up because i clearly haven’t read enough stories i feel kinda awkward and it sucks LMAOOO so. makes me wanna read so i’m also in the know


there are a lot of stories i saw people’s reactions to first, but only got the time to read it months or even years later. so it’s fun to get the chance to read it and then compare my own impression of the story vs the reactions i had seen.


UHHH maybe there’s more. but in short i’ve always found enstars writing fun, and it keeps pulling me back in and motivating me to pick up more and more stories!
an interesting question to be asked and i had to sit on this for a while like &quot;omg is it really that rare!?&quot; (GENUINELY SURPRISED BUT NOT OFFENDED) so thank you for asking!

    <title>Answered Question: Favorite Thing About Each Ryuseitai Member</title>
    <url>//20240905_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
What’s your favorite thing about each member of Ryuseitai?

Sent and answered in September 2024. tweet link of the answer

HMMM that’s a tough question because i’m never able to narrow my choice down to one because i love too many things about each ryuseitai member… i think i’ll go with specifically a trait that excites me SO much and if i ever hear about it i’m SO on my way. EASIEST WAY TO BAIT ME
♥ chiaki: i love deranged chiaki i love obnoxiously loud chiaki i LOVE LOVE LOVE i can never get tired of seeing him be this way. my favorite thing EVER is seeing chiaki thrive and loosen up and do whatever he feels like doing in that moment and on that day. IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO MEEEE this is why i can never get enough of his interactions with midori because he really lets himself loose with midori. never holds back. just 1000% unhinged, obnoxious, loud, annoying, clingy, pushy, active, EVERYTHING EVERY SINGLE THING
💚 midori: love love L O V E the way midori is so kind and empathetic beneath all the confusing or harsh things he says. i truly will never get tired of seeing this and i’m so glad it continues to be relevant even into his 3rd year. it is so much fun to figure out where the kindness lies in the strange or even rude things he’s saying. i love how midori’s rudeness or harshness is a big necessity in ryuseitai and especially in chiaki’s life. i feel like there is such a better way for me to describe what i love about this but whenever i see it i’m obsessed. also i love how because of this, his kindness is so natural… like midori never brings himself to Be kind (though he sometimes thinks or talks as though it Is something that drains him or he finds a bother) HE JUST NATURALLY IS KIND. he’s so naturally kind that even the moments he’s being a huge pain, he’s still kind lmao. wub. maybe another way to describe this is &quot;indirect kindness&quot;. his words don’t straightforwardly sound kind, but ultimately what he’s doing or expressing is such a gentle, important thing the person needed to hear (ahem. chiaki)
🖤 tetora: his design-- ok i want to also talk about his personality too but HIS DESIGNNNN MY FAVORITE THING IS TETORA’S CHARACTER DESIGN IT’S SO GOOD IT’S SO HANDSOME IT’S SO PERFECTLY CRAFTED AND THE WAY HAPIELE DRAWS IT IN ART MAKES ME SO. WHAT THE FUCK. FUCK. tetora definitely has one of my favorite visual designs if not THE ultimate favorite (but i have a feeling if i ever did a ranking he could easily come out on top). i’m so weak to handsome masculine boys that can pull off practically any look… godtier btw. in terms of personality/story, i think he is SUCH a versatile character who works with ANYONE. his dynamics with practically anyone is so colorful and fun to see. he’s compatible with anyone to the point he can even work with people he seems like he wouldn’t be compatible with… the power of being really good at communication. that’s tetora :)
💙 kanata: i love how human he is!! or like, i love how kanata is about how he isn’t just some cryptid. his writing and storyline is sooo unique because he starts off with everyone around him, even himself, treating him as some mysterious person… but it all slowly unravels, he’s treated as a human being with emotions too… with his own thoughts and feelings and own reasons for doing things. IDK it’s hard to explain what i mean exactly but basically my favorite thing is how everything he does is for a very Very &quot;human&quot; reason. i’ve been around since ! era stories when his mysterious side was much stronger than his human side, so realizing this about kanata really made me connect with him a LOT better…
💛 shinobu: I L O V E when shinobu’s ninja side is utilized as A GENUINE THING THAT IS USEFUL AND PRACTICAL IN SITUATIONS. one of my favorite things ever. actually i just love how he quite literally grew to embody the concept of &quot;ninja hero&quot;. there are so many things he does for the sake of helping others, but approaches it as a ninja. i love love LOVE how he is so reliable with utilizing his ninja techniques that he is constantly tasked to do many ninja-like missions (going on a spy mission, retrieving information, etc.). i just… love it when shinobu is taken seriously and as someone who is genuinely capable and strong. i love how shinobu BEING taken seriously is part of WHY he became so capable and strong. HE IS A NINJA!!!!!!!!
hehe it was fun gushing about ryuseitai… thank you for asking!!

    <title>Answered Question: What I Miss from ! Era (Pre-Enstars Music days)</title>
    <url>//20240916_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
is there any game feature (or just anything in general)that you miss from the game ! era?

Sent and answered in September 2024. tweet link of the answer

i know why this got changed and it makes logical sense… so this is something i miss while being aware why it’s gone now, but…
event bgms. god i miss unique event bgms for every single event in enstars. i realize how much i miss event bgms the moment i open climax in-game and start BAWLING MY FUCKING EYES OUT JUST HEARING THAT GODAMN BGM IN THE EPILOGUES. I’M TAKEN STRAIGHT BACK TO 2017, TO THE VERY FIRST TIME I EXPERIENCED THE EVENT
instrumental version of unit/shuffle songs for the event makes sense, and i know why it’s like that nowadays, but it’s Just Not The Same. it’s really not the same as hearing that unique event bgm specifically designed for THAT event. every single bgm i got to be there for holds a special memory to me. just hearing it take me immediately back to the days i was grinding day in and out, or reading the story bit by bit and crying or enjoying myself… but especially the grinding like gosh you would hear the bgm 24/7 if you played the game in those days. so you just KNOW which bgm is for which event. it just hits sooo different
&quot;what about tour event bgm—&quot; IT’S NOT THE SAMEEE IT WAS FOR EVERY EVENT BACK THEN /lh tour event bgms are close but sadly, not the same experience. for example, in music most times you’re actually playing other songs unrelated to the event, especially on tour, so the only time you hear the bgm is when you’re on the event page or reading the last few chapters of the story.
on the other hand, basic Sort Of retained this experience since the bgm is looped while you’re grinding events, but since it’s limited to only tour events (which are about 7-8 times a year) it’s still such a limited experience compared to how Every Event Would Get One in ! era… (but i definitely consider it a unique charm point about basic tbh!!) i also feel like back then ! era really REALLY heavily put in a lot of effort in the bgms because they were a big part of the game’s production, whereas nowadays a lot of the budget goes into, obviously, the actual MVs and its songs… so while tours are also good bgms and i have some attached memories with a few, nothing hits as hard as hearing a ! era event bgm. but maybe nostalgia is talking too
but i acknowledge and understand why it never will be the same (especially since nowadays i make memories through my first experience with an MV and such which is even more insane to experience), so i regard it as something special about the ! era days rather than &quot;BRING IT BACK!!!!!&quot;
i think there’s a few other things i miss (remember when akira would write gachas way more often in ! era haha DAMN… the schedule back then was weird but fun) but my no.1 answer will always be the event bgms. they were magical

    <title>Answered Question: Perception of Canon and its Relationships</title>
    <url>//20240921_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[i accidentally linked this post to a question about midori's inner thoughts about chiaki, please go here for the answer to that question!!
--

those two asks answered my question pretty much! but i do find your perspective fascinating because i don’t think approaching relationships from this sort of angle is really common in fandom? or in my experience at least. i really like your explanation of characters being fundamentally the answer to each other, but i wouldn’t say such a broad perspective is really common among fans. because the topic of ships can be such a touch-y subject for many people, i noticed some tend to hone in on specific dynamics, and ignore everything else that might possibly interfere with it (even fundamentally important platonic relationships!!). but i do think there’s value in analyzing things even if you don’t per se enjoy it, and that itself can be worthy of analysis too!

Sent and answered in September 2024. tweet link of the answer. continuation of this ask

weh i’m glad, thank you for reading them 😭😭 YEAH IT’S NOT COMMON LOL… i notice it quite often among the fandom and i don’t blame them like I Get it, plus it’s not like it’s mandatory to consume every dynamic your fav has LMAO but yeah, it’s not how i explore canon personally…
like i actually think midochia is MORE elevated by ALLLLLL the relationships around the two and midochia’s dynamic itself is what gets me FURTHER invested in the rest of their dynamics and vice versa. i can’t get myself to consume midochia separately and independently from other relationships. in fact i talk about tetora and chiaki’s relationship here (romantic mentions in the ask) while relating it directly back to my love for midochia, and the same with when i spoke about tetora and midori’s relationship here. BOTH OF WHICH ARE CRUCIAL RELATIONSHIPS TO UNDERSTAND MIDOCHIA SO FUCKING MUCH. I CAN TALK ABOUT IT FOR YEARS. but also that i will be speaking about it while being Extremely Biased towards midochia and in the context of &quot;midochia are the answer to each other’s arcs&quot; because that’s my perception of canon and what i believe canon is working towards. (you don’t have to read those asks btw i’m just insane about midochia and ryuseitai)
and YEAH!!! THERE’S ALWAYS VALUE IN ANALYSIS I AGREE! sometimes there’s some dynamics i’m Extremely Neutral about but i acknowledge they have a lot of canon relevance so i still want to make sense of that… sometimes it’s the opposite, i’m well aware canon is saying these two won’t healthily work for each other but that’s why i’m so invested in it LMAO i won’t even BOTHER to pretend they’re The Answer to each other’s arcs!!! i know they probably will never be on the same page AND IT’S SO GOOD!!!
and i feel like all of this thinking and analyzing gives me a better picture of Why these dynamics exist for the character since i truly believe practically any dynamic established in enstars has a reason and purpose to it (especially if akira is the one who wrote it. that guy is extremely deliberate with his writing choices imo). and i absolutely Never Ever think platonic relationships are less relevant than romantically-written relationships… in fact what i love So Much about enstars is that platonically-written and romantically-written relationships both hold so SO much weight and are so crucial and it’s so good… so fucking good GUHHHH (and as mentioned in the asks i linked and in here, sometimes i actually do romantically ship the platonically-written dynamic so it reaaally has nothing to do with my ship preferences LOL) (Except Midochia.) (i’m just plain insane about midochia it’s on a different level entirely)

    <title>Answered Question: Midori’s Inner Thoughts Regarding Chiaki Prior to Climax</title>
    <url>//20250606_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Ask No.1: I’m very curious about how would you resume Midori’s mental state before, during and after Climax 🤔 I know Chiaki was mostly hiding his true feelings but Midori I think it was much… Complicated? Or something like that? I think I need a second opinion about Midori more than Chiaki, but if you want, you can also say your opinion about Chiaki 😓 sorry if it’s too much trouble


Ask No.2: I don’t know what happened with a question I made a while ago, but I wanted to ask it again in case it didn’t get through 😭 the question: how was Midori’s mind working before, during, and after Climax towards Chiaki? What inner thoughts were inside his mind? I don’t know if they explored the before climax event thoughts, but I would like to know what’s your opinion on it 👀

Sent in September 2024, answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

for starters, i am so, SO sorry for how long this took. ever since september ’24, work has been a rollercoaster that demotivated me out of a lot of things. i kept wanting to write an answer to this, and i just never had the emotional energy for it 😭 but i’m slowly getting back my pace…!! i completely understand if this answer took too long, but i’m still so glad to get this ask all the same, so thank you for sending it!! ❤️
--
THIS IS A REALLY FUN QUESTION FOR ME!!! midori’s mental state before, during, and after repayment festival are actually so integral to his relationship with chiaki and answer a lot about why he acts a certain way (particularly his actions in !! era)
i talked about it before in a thread lovemailing the beauty of zodiac midori leading up to the current midori. i ABSOLUTELY recommend reading it because i think it answers your question! in this post, i’ll break the thread down even further so it’s (hopefully) easier to make sense of what i meant. …hopefully. so a lot of what i say here might feel more complete when read along with the thread!
BUT, DISCLAIMER THAT what i’ve written here is just a simplified summary. each segment has a lot of layers and depth to it… so there are definitely more nuances to it than what i’ve written here!
indeed, midori is pretty complex because he went through various stages with chiaki, relationship wise, emotional wise, etc… all of which are interesting and important. SOOOOOOO IMPORTANT to the point that if you alter any of them, their relationship just wouldn’t work.
==
when they first meet, midori starts off feeling like chiaki is an overwhelming, confusing, obnoxious and suffocating person who just won’t leave him alone, and he can’t for the life of him understand Why. no matter how many times he tries to escape or push chiaki away, chiaki just comes back stronger and more persistent. midori attempting to skip practice so much is WHY chiaki started to pick him up from his home in the first place. (something midori never asked for! among many other things he never asked chiaki to do, ever)
we don’t really get that many glimpses of this anxiety in stories, but climax reveals to us that a chunk of his behavior with ryuseitai and especially chiaki is the fear of not living up to people’s expectations of him. that people expect something amazing and wonderful from midori because of his looks, get to know who he truly is, find out he’s &quot;nothing special&quot;, and get severely disappointed and leave him. experiencing that had really warped midori’s perception of himself (thinking he truly has NOTHING in him and that nobody can change that &quot;fact&quot;), and made him believe only his family would ever love him for who he truly is deep down.
so imagine that midori, who came out of all those experiences back in middle school, immediately being bombarded with this relentless senior who’s convinced there’s something in him, that &quot;he has the qualities to be a hero&quot;… it’s terrifying because why the hell would chiaki see that in him???
but despite midori’s attempts to escape or his whining, chiaki continued to pull him back in and get him to &quot;show his potential&quot;. and this meant day in and out, midori would experience the shenanigans and the &quot;mess&quot; that is ryuseitai, this unit that seems to barely take itself seriously and yet apparently totally does because &quot;we’re heroes!&quot;
as much as it exhausted him, he eventually gave in to it because it’s &quot;too late to quit this school now&quot;, &quot;i don’t really have much of a choice at this point&quot;, etc… and that constant persistence to be pulled back into the light and warmth of chiaki and ryuseitai eventually became the norm for midori. this is where hero show, supernova, and plenty of other summer stories happen. supernova in particular marks the point where midori TRULY realizes he’s doing something he would’ve NEVER done if he didn’t enter the idol course, and seeing his middle school classmate just being a &quot;normal person like he once was&quot; while he’s on stage further amplified that realization… but most of all, it makes him realize that after all that exhaustion and hell practice he went through… he’s actually happy here, with ryuseitai.
and from there on, this new norm becomes so commonplace for midori that it feels worse when it ISN’T him with ryuseitai (like in orihime and hikoboshi. he didn’t enjoy practice with trickstar much, mostly because of subaru, and felt relief when chiaki and kanata were finally back.)
HERE is where we enter midori’s potential as a hero budding and taking form, slowly but surely. and this beautifully transitions to the stories that explore midori’s feelings towards chiaki: sweet halloween (autumn season) and zodiac (winter season)
before that, one thing i LOVE about the summer stories is that it’s also the time midori is most annoyed and fed up with chiaki, usually expressing it in a &quot;it’s already hot as it is (during the summer weather), can you NOT make it worse (with your suffocatingly hot personality)&quot;. this makes the contrast between summer midori and autumn midori so cute, because he shows explicit signs of warming up even MORE to ryuseitai in autumn, as it’s no longer a season with exhausting hot weather to deal with on top of chiaki. summer was also a veeeery busy time for ryuseitai, and then they had a break in summer from work (that chiaki himself made sure to give them), and i feel like that also contributed to his warming up to them throughout summer and his potential finally taking form after all the new experiences.
==
and so, this perfectly leads into sweet halloween, where midori learns something entirely different and opposite of what he’s understood about chiaki so far. all this time he’s grown so used to chiaki being overly energetic, overly loud, overly suffocating, constantly pestering him to do things, etc… but in this case, he’s quieter? he’s fidgeting? he seems overwhelmed, to the point that he has no time to &quot;pester&quot; midori…? i find it very interesting that the reason midori picked up on chiaki acting weird was because chiaki’s behavior lacked the traits that he kept seeing from him over the past few months. it went against midori’s norm. the norm that chiaki HIMSELF created by constantly committing his time and efforts to midori day after day.
also, midori’s intrigue and confusion about chiaki’s &quot;different&quot; behavior implies to me that he’s been subconsciously seeking for answers behind a lot of questions he’s had about chiaki up until this point. &quot;what is up with this guy&quot; &quot;why is he like this&quot; &quot;is he seriously always this energetic? how is that even possible?&quot; and so on and so forth… and finding out chiaki has such a massive &quot;weakness&quot; to him likely meant the world to midori, hence him trying to get to the bottom of it in sweet halloween.
up until this point, chiaki has felt too… Unnaturally Perfect. Too unnaturally capable of constantly giving, providing, and always being there for other people. he even managed to get the reluctant, unwilling midori to open himself up a little more. but it's hard to shake off the feeling that chiaki is hiding something about himself… namely, traits that would make him less perfect, less reliably capable, but… it would make him more human.
this story marks a MASSIVE milestone for midori and finally makes that &quot;bud of potential&quot; inside him take form, albeit still small and fragile. he’s the only person in ryuseitai who very quickly picked up on something strange happening with chiaki, all due to how much his current norm is related to him. but unfortunately, by the end of sweet halloween, the most he managed to do is notice it enough for chiaki to admit it to the rest of ryuseitai, and try to subtly be there for chiaki, and… that’s kind of it. he tried to convey his feelings to chiaki, telling him &quot;it’s okay to be yourself&quot;, but chiaki didn’t hear it…💔 hence it being the start of that small budding of his form of heroism.
and this is where the rest of my thread comes into play, especially for during and after climax, so i really recommend reading it!
midori tripped up a lot while his potential was taking form. midori felt embarrassed (zodiac), incapable (chiaki’s as well as his own crying scene in climax), or like a failure for trying (this happened more often in !! era though), but he never fully gave up either. every struggle made him attempt a new way to grab hold of chiaki. that's where his desperation starts to kick in in !! era, namely after motor show and during comet show. (note that this ask does NOT cover anything about ES2 midori!)
but since this ask is mostly about pre-climax, i’ll stop here!! i had SOO MUCH FUN WITH THIS, I WANTED TO GIVE IT AS MUCH ATTENTION AS I COULD BECAUSE I LOVE!!! MIDORI’S PSYCHE!!!! THERE’S SO MUCH TO BE SAID!! i might expand on this whenever i have the time (or the midori brain worms get to me), and i’ll mention on twitter if that ever happens! thank you again ❤️

    <title>Answered Question: Midori &amp; Subaru&#39;s Relationship</title>
    <url>//20250606_2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
It haunts me for weeks but wdyt about Subaru x Midori (or Midori x Subaru whatever your preference) as ship? (about 2 people who crazy with Chiaki lmao)

Sent in September 2024, answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

(i took a long while to respond to this but i finally got the time to do it now!!)
LOVE their dynamic, love their history, love everything about them, but from a romantic perspective i don't really ship them. the only way i've thought about them in a romantic (?) way is when i've thought up some new idea on how to torture midori (as midori x subaru). and even then it's going to be midochia endgame, so i'd feel bad calling it an actual idea for the ship KSEGMSEKGK
the few ideas i've had before typically have something to do with chiaki (best point about these two, yum), with midori feeling lonely in his 2nd year, so subaru offers to be that replacement as a way to bond with midori and to continue chiaki's legacy in the basketball club. it goes terribly because subaru is Nothing like chiaki at all and midori's miserable, but it's the thought that counts ❤️
but for a more serious (?) answer, i like that subaru acts as a really good motivator for midori, since midori works So well with spiteful feelings, and i like that subaru has learned to approach constructive criticism with more empathy thanks to his clash with midori back in orihime and hikoboshi!! i love these two… so much…
i love how their relationship shows why chiaki's disposition worked so well with both of them, especially midori (who genuinely can't stand subaru vs how he's got much more complex feelings about chiaki). i like to think up ideas of how subaru's mere presence motivates midori to try harder, or maybe even the opposite. or just cute shenanigans between them during the basketball club until chiaki comes out of nowhere and annoys them…🥰
shout out and throwback to their interaction in 9.5 anniversary, and its subtle nod to their interaction in SS finals 😊
EDIT: i just remembered i actually did try to answer this question months ago, and i only found that answer just now…! so i’ll drop it in here:
i don’t romantically ship it but their dynamic and relationship matters A L O T to me, including the influence they’ve had on each other because of their common link (chiaki being their senpai, chiaki having clung onto both of them, chiaki being why they even talk to each other since he invited both of them to the basketball club. just chiaki being the center point)
i think they’re such an important existence in each other’s lives, for subaru it helped him understand how to approach people with more sensitivity, and even connect with parts about himself (realizing he felt lonely and is still affected by that time in his 1st year for ex.) , and for midori… omfg god the things subaru has influenced midori to be able to do is sooooo good in so many ways. love the way we learn through his relationship with subaru that spite is an actual big motivating factor for him (something completely &quot;negative&quot; is actually really &quot;positive&quot; to midori showing his capabilities!). BUT ALSO. LOVE THE WAY IT’S BOTH SOOOO FUCKING FUNNY BUT ALSO SO IMPORTANT.
FOR EXAMPLE I WILL NEVER!!!!!! GET OVER!!!!!!!! THE WAY MIDORI’S PETTY FEELINGS TOWARDS SUBARU IS WHY A VERY MAJOR IMPORTANT EVENT HAPPENED IN RYUSEITAI’S STORYLINE.
(answer abruptly ends here, which is probably why i forgot i even wrote it 😅)

    <title>Answered Question: Fandom’s Reaction to The First Reveal Of Glasses Chiaki (Crossroad)</title>
    <url>//20250608_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Question! Don’t remember if you answered this before or if you were even part of the Enstars fandom back then, back the Crossroad event was the one that first revealed Chiaki wears glasses (and showed his meeker personality) right? If you were already in the fandom then, do you happen to remember how fans reacted to that? I imagine it caused quite a bit of chaos (affectionate) among ChiakiPs 😂

Sent in September 2024, answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

(i took a long while to respond to this but i finally got the time to do it now!!)
yeah, i was there for it! it was indeed The Event to reveal something so mindblowingly New and Unimagined about chiaki, which is so bizarre to think about now because, wow… past chiaki being meek and wearing glasses all the time is just a completely well-known fact nowadays, thanks to meteor impact.
alright, this requires SO MUCH CONTEXT BEFORE I GET TO THE FANDOM’S REACTION. there are layers to this (kinda)
theories about past chiaki
prior to crossroad’s release, fans had their own theories what sort of person chiaki was pre-3rd year. a lot of it was based on the very little we knew so far, which was:

kuro mentioning that midori is similar to past chiaki (said right after midori was being meek and scared in front of kuro) (tough guy)
chiaki mentioning he used to cry a lot when he first started out as a leader (christmas live)
chiaki mentioning how he struggled so much that at one point, seeing the color red made him sick, and mentioning he used to cry himself to sleep (climax)
kanata mentioning chiaki saved him and taught him many things (supernova, scroll of the elements), and kanata and chiaki making a promise to each other (christmas live)
how desolate ryuseitai was back then and how it affected chiaki (wisteria), and chiaki saying he was actually in ryuseitai to benefit off of it (climax)

some of these made people go &quot;WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN…???&quot; but some were Just Enough to make up theories and think up ideas of how past chiaki must’ve been like.
past chiaki fanworks would range in various ways, but i’d say the two main ways were either &quot;how did kanata and chiaki meet&quot; (based on any hints the two spoke of about each other) or &quot;depressed/meek chiaki&quot; (based on the concerning things chiaki has said about his past self).
the former was a lot more focused on illustrating how the two met and how chiaki invited kanata over to ryuseitai, so it wouldn’t necessarily depict chiaki depressed or meek (at most, it would show chiaki cry but that’s about it)… but the latter was ALL about that, so there were some extremely depressing fanworks back in the day of past chiaki having depressing/anxious thoughts, or of him legitimately crying himself to sleep, etc.
there was one theory that wasn’t common, but i was a huge fan of and would hunt down anything that saw the vision, and it’s ryusei green chiaki. this one is obviously Very Fixated on the tough guy hint, where kuro notes midori reminds him of past chiaki, and chiaki immediately tries to change the subject. i was really obsessed with this idea because the depressed/crying chiaki hints gave me life back then, and i was hungry for ryuseitai reminiscence because i Wanted to die by the angst (this is funny in retrospect because when meteor impact finally came out years later i legitimately became emotionally broken by the heaviness of that story LMFAO. be careful what you wish for !)
and there was another past chiaki theory that had already been debunked mid of 2016 when element came out: ex-fine!chiaki. i came into the fandom late 2016, so i wasn’t really here for the craze of this theory nor how it felt to see it get debunked, but it existed (because of eichi calling chiaki by his first name) and it also explored a depressed/unsure chiaki being part of a &quot;justice&quot; unit that doesn’t feel like the real justice he wants. i talk in more detail about eichi/chiaki relationship theories prior to the hospital friends reveal in this ask for anyone curious!!
SO personally, that was my experience back then before crossroad came out. i was consuming any and all depressed past chiaki fanworks i came across, and chiakiP at the time were also very invested in the hints chiaki mentioned about his past self.
and no matter how different people approached it, all these theories and delusions had one thing in common: none of them depicted chiaki with a different appearance in any way, since none of the hints implied that he might’ve looked different.
crossroad event preview
there’s one more important thing to mention before i get to the fandom’s reaction. in 2017, we were hit with insane emotional rollercoasters one after the other. among some of them were setsubun, four beasts of fistfighting, and climax, which were big ones for fans of 1st year characters, but suddenly a month later we finally get a new reminiscence… FOR TRICKSTAR. the sudden resurgence of reminiscence stories made the fandom go wild, wondering if we’re getting any other past stories this year.
then suddenly we get a new character, The Mikejima Madara Himself, and now ryuseitai fans are going insane because THE &quot;FESTIVAL GUY&quot; WAS MENTIONED IN CLIMAX AS AN EX-RYUSEITAI MEMBER. DOES THIS MEAN RYUSEITAI REMINISCENCE IS UPON US SOON!? then wisteria (madara’s introduction story) comes out and REVEALS MORE INSANE SHIT ABOUT PAST RYUSEITAI, PAST CHIAKI AND KANATA, AND THAT MADARA AND KANATA ARE CHILDHOOD FRIENDS???? shit was so wild in 2017!!
personally, i was going even MORE insane about all the theories and possibilities of past ryuseitai after madara came out, like wondering what color madara could’ve been if chiaki was ryusei green. (note that we didn’t learn about ryusei purple until sept 2017 with aquarium) and chiaki being so meek and self-deprecating around madara fueled me to keep up the ryusei green chiaki theory. wisteria also has a scene that makes it sound like madara was the reason ryuseitai fell apart in the past, so THAT was fun to think about too. (note, this ends up being heavy unreliable narration from the characters since meteor impact reveals otherwise). but that was just me, for the fandom they were still mostly like &quot;W-WAIT COULD WE BE NEXT IN LINE FOR A REMINISCENCE STORY…??&quot;
well, lucky for the fandom because 1 month later IT WAS THE CHECKMATE. fans are now going fucking crazyyyyy. people are either dying by checkmate, or starting to list off what other things we could get reminiscence of, like deadmans, the other eccentric’s battles in the war, ryuseitai, etc… particularly ryuseitai, because madara was in checkmate and ryuseitai was mentioned a bit so it was like UMMM…???? ARE WE SOON…???
so by this point, people were expecting more and more reminiscence stories because it seemed like a &quot;pattern&quot;. and so, when people waited on july 27th for the next event preview, it was both super hype that it’s yet another reminiscence for the month AND… THE APPEARANCE OF 2ND YEAR KEITO AND IN DEADMANS, NO LESS. THE MEGANE TEMPLE GUY LOOKING ALL LIKE THAT. honestly crossroad keito’s reveal had its own interesting reactions, but i’m not keitoP so it’s sadly very badly documented on my old twitter. all i know is apparently according to my tweets, we had already known a deadmans song was gonna be released with the undead CD by this point (i don’t remember through what, because i can’t find what deadmans song announcement had happened before crossroad event), so that’s why it made sense that we’d get a deadmans reminiscence event.
anyway, crossroad event has been previewed. since the high rarity cards were keito, rei, koga and kuro, people assumed that it’s going to have all the undead and akatsuki members in the story. but that only adds up to 7 cards, and events back then always at least had 8 cards released per event. and back then you HAD to wait for gacha/event release to know all the cards. it wasn’t like how it is now where they just post all the cards of each new content.
so now, there are theories of who the last 3* could be. i don’t remember people’s speculations, but mine at the time were madara, eichi, ritsu, or kanata. madara because he was being inserted in every story back then probably to get him caught up with the other characters + his relations with keito were established by this point. eichi because it’s eichi. ritsu because of rei, and kanata because of the hints in scroll of the elements that keito and kanata had some sort of beef in the past. note how there is 0 chiaki speculation in here, despite how excited and obsessed i was with past chiaki…❤️
things are calm between the preview and the few hours before event story release on july 31st. hinata was the gacha for crossroad, and tetora was a 3* card in it, and i tweeted this at the time: &quot;anyway august just started and a ryuseitai member got a new card, so that silence for half a month was nice while it lasted&quot; (me @ 2017 me: They Don’t Know.) i was just tweeting random shit, posting random screenshots, until…. it was The Day Of The Event.
crossroad event release
as soon as the event started, i opened the event rewards to see who the last 3* was (the usual way people would learn who the 3*s were for an event back then), and i’m just gonna post the tweets at the time because i think they speak for themselves:

and meanwhile, came the flood of everyone’s reactions (including mine):
"HE WAS A NERD?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
"I CAN’T BELIEVE CHIAKI WAS A MEGANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
the entirety of enstars twitter fucking broke apart, regardless of the language. the whole story was released at once, so everyone was dying for several different reasons. the depressing story, the reveal of how the characters looked back then, their casual outfits, everyone had some reaction to Something in the story.
my first reaction, as well as some others’ first reaction to chiaki’s appearance? Well:

.group-picture .group-picture-column {
flex: none;
}

@media only screen and (max-width:650px) {
    .group-picture .group-picture-column {
    flex: 1;
    }
}




guys. (still relevant to this day btw He He He He…)
there was also a megane chiaki card tweet at the time that got A LOT of RTs and likes saying, &quot;clothes are green! glasses are black! attribute is yellow! feelings are blue! ryusei red! morisawa chiaki!!&quot; WHICH I STILL THINK IS REALLY CLEVER OMG… do they know they predicted meteor impact’s themes for past chiaki /lh
as someone who was insanely obsessed with the idea of ryusei green chiaki, this was CRAZY. THE IDEA THAT ENSTARS WOULD ACTUALLY RELATE CHIAKI TO GREEN IN SOME WAY, EVEN IF IT’S JUST HIS CASUAL OUTFIT??? i was broken. not to mention i fucking LOVE nerd megane characters (enstars initially piqued my interest because of keito being the ultimate megane anime guys trope), so it felt like fate for my favorite character to actually be a megane all along, even if it’s possibly only how he was in the past.
speaking of which, then came in everyone’s theories of what this could mean about chiaki’s eyesight… wait, does this mean current chiaki wears contacts? did he only wear glasses to avoid standing out in the past? IS HE JUST THAT MUCH OF THE NERD TROPE ALL ALONG!? there were memes just as much as there were genuine attempts to figure out what this means for 3rd year chiaki. by this point, stories did make it more clear that chiaki isn’t actually an idiot, but he was still mostly seen as &quot;the idiot hot-blooded hero&quot; by the fandom, so the thought he could actually be The Megane Nerd Trope was mindblowing for the general fan.
checkmate had a megane reveal too, that revealed arashi used to wear glasses… but it did give an explanation of why in the story (she was imitating akiomi), so chiakiP wondered if it’s possible chiaki’s reasoning could be something similar (i.e. purely temporary thing he had done for a very specific reason, rather than because his eyesight’s bad)
meanwhile, fandom was also compiling all reminiscence appearances for characters, and the only one left for the yumenosaki 3rd years at the time was kanata. so there was THAT &quot;HOLY FUCK WE’RE DOOMED&quot; feeling too, knowing this means kanata is FOR SURE going to be the 5* of the ryuseitai reminiscence. i remember trying to predict when ryuseitai reminiscence could happen PURELY through how long ago kanata’s last 5* was LOL.
event story thoughts
translation of chiaki’s scenes in crossroad can be found here, in case re-reading them helps envision the fandom’s reaction back then!
AND THEN, I FINALLY UNLOCKED THE STORY AMIDST MY MINDBLOWN BRAIN AND SHAKINGS HANDS, AND STARTED TO LIVETWEET IT. i tried to get a translation out asap BECAUSE HOOOLY SHIT CHIAKI’S SCENES WERE CRAZY. HE WAS SO MEEK AND SCARED WHILE BEING MADE FUN OF BUT HE WAS STILL TRYING TO BE A HERO!? HE TRIED TO SAVE A TIED-UP EICHI?! THIS IS RELEVANT TO THE CROSSROAD PLOT BECAUSE HE INADVERTENTLY RUINED KEITO’S PLAN BY DOING THIS…!?!? CHIAKI USED TO CALL THE OTHER 3RD YEARS BY &quot;-KUN&quot;!? KURO AND CHIAKI FRIENDSHIP!??!?!? KURO AND CHIAKI WERE THE NERD BEFRIENDS DELINQUENT TROPE!?!?!?
this is the 3rd reminiscence in the same year, so fans were fueled even more that SURELY, SURELY RYUSEITAI IS SOON?! AFTER ALL THESE BUILDING BLOCKS WERE ADDED IN THE SAME YEAR…??
little did we know they had WAAAAY more in mind for us than just that (like, we didn’t even know about how kanata was seen as a living god by his household yet, that was revealed a whole month later. WE DIDN’T EVEN KNOW ABOUT JIN HAVING RELATIONS TO RYUSEITAI JUST YET EITHER!!!!). little did we know that chiaki wearing glasses wasn’t even a thing of the past. that he actually STILL wears them… and we only found out about THAT part months later in sweet halloween, another insane event for chiaki’s lore!!
but gosh i remember so many fans, me included, feeling both shocked and pleasantly surprised by the story reveal, but also so sad for him because he Did Not Seem Okay. there’s the obvious one where he was mocked on stage, but his last chapter in crossroad gave really worrying signs of someone desperate to be a hero and struggling in an environment that’s constantly against him. so a lot of crossroad chiaki fanworks were either meek glasses chiaki trying his best but clearly scared, or sometimes much more desolate like him being bullied.
meanwhile, him legitimately being A Megane Boy Who Was Made Fun Of made chiaki’s classic &quot;SHUT UP, FOUR EYES&quot; at akiomi in the main story even more ⁉ because wait a second… YOU were a megane too, though?! huh!? (little did we know, we were eventually going to learn that chiaki has a complex about his glasses self and it actually makes perfect sense… 😊)
the theories and meta were FLOOOODINGGGG my twitter TL throughout the event period. sadly i don’t remember much of it anymore, and i can’t find them either, but based on my reaction tweets back then, people were likely linking 2nd year chiaki back to all the hints we got so far (like how chiaki said he got sick of the color red at one point), as well as talking about how far he’s come based on climax, supernova, etc.
but most of all, &quot;oh god, are we really ready for ryuseitai reminiscence???&quot; like okay we knew chiaki was depressed, we knew he cried a lot in the past, but… possible bullying!?!? he was a nerd!? like, it was really shocking but exciting to see the hints we had known thus far come to life in an ACTUAL 2nd year chiaki scene, while still not knowing much about ryuseitai’s reminiscence yet.
it took until gang came out in 2018 for us to find out JUST HOW HORRIBLE HIS SITUATION WAS BACK THEN. HE WAS LEGITIMATELY BULLIED BY RYUSEITAI MEMBERS???? WHAT???? while crossroad does mention that the ryuseitai members weren’t Good Students, it was still mostly fan speculation that he could have been bullied by them. before gang came out, most of us were still under the impression that it’s mostly just the delinquents who looked down on him, not his own unit members…
random tangent about the fandom, but tsumugi’s birthday happened in the middle of the crossroad event, and his birthday somehow broke the servers and it took a WHILE for it to be fixed. i don’t 100% remember anymore what the bugs were, but it was practically impossible to play his birthday campaign and i think the crossroad event too. fans could barely celebrate the poor guy’s birthday. so that was also mixed in as a new historical event for the fandom too LMAO
but yeah, for crossroad chiaki, there were just… SOOOO many fanworks of connecting 2nd year chiaki to his present (3rd year) self, happy with ryuseitai!! getting what he wanted! so much focus on how his &quot;it’ll be okay!&quot; sounded so weak and fearful… so much on how he tried to be a hero no matter how scared he was… the resurgence of theories about eichi and chiaki’s possible relationship (i talk about that here)… some people just straight up feeling so horribly sad about his crossroad scenes that they instead drew nerd chiaki being cute and happy
keep in mind crossroad WAS IN THE SAME YEAR AS CLIMAX, THE RYUSEITAI REPAYMENT FESTIVAL STORY. AND THE SAME YEAR AS ALL THESE OTHER INSANE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTERS ENSTARS THREW AT THE FANDOM. AND NOT TO MENTION!!! RYUSEITAI 3RD CD WAS JUST AROUND THE CORNER TOO SO IT WAS AN INSANE WEEK FOR A RYUSEITAIP!!
in retrospect, 2017 was truly fucking insane in so many ways omg… like megane chiaki was IN LATE JULY. we still had the rest of the year for whatever else they were planning to throw at us. and god, did they throw A Lot on just ryuseitaiP alone.
to conclude… it was truly a monumental moment. who would’ve fucking thought crossroad would be where chiakiP get to be fed. the fact it still took another 2 years for us to get ryuseitai reminiscence after all those reveals makes it even crazier… they really made us sit on all those random hints and small reveals of past chiaki until we finally got The Story. kanata’s appearance reveal took all the way until meteor impact too, so even though fans knew chiaki was a megane by now, fanworks depicting past chiaki and kanata still had kanata looking the same as he did in his 3rd year. which is interesting, because it means you can actually pinpoint when a past kanata &amp; chiaki fanwork must’ve been drawn based on their appearances alone LOL
this was really long, but i had to break down every layer of what it meant to wake up on july 31st to megane chiaki. genuinely crazy and chaotic and unpredictable. and now i can’t imagine an enstars without megane chiaki, hehe 😊💞 i hope this was a fun read, and i badly hope megane chiaki makes his comeback in !! era eventually, because i just know it would break the fandom all over again… it’s been so long since his last megane card (since 2019…)
thank you for asking, it was so much fun to go down a nostalgia trip and really remind myself how Important that moment was for chiakiP!! if you’re interested in more fandom history, i’m slowly compiling all my answers in the fandom history category ❤️

    <title>Answered Question: Interviewing Akira</title>
    <url>//20250608_2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Hi! If you had the chance to interview Akira (and any other subwriter), what would you ask them?

Sent in September 2024, answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

this ask was sent to me months back in september 2024, and a lot has changed about enstars since then… but first, i’ll answer with what i would’ve said back in september!!
if i had the chance to interview akira or any of the writers, i would LOVE to know the writing process. do they work off of notes, are they given a baseline of what the next event has to be about and what they have to add, etc. i’m so curious about the writing process behind event stories especially.
for questions to akira specifically, i would even want to know stuff like, does he refresh himself by rereading past stories before writing a new lore-heavy story? some plotlines he’s written are such insane callbacks to really old stories that there’s no way he could still remember that without notes or re-reading the story. and i mean REALLY miniscule details from past stories suddenly being relevant out of nowhere. and where does he even get the inspiration to write about some of the stuff he integrates in stories, anyway. sometimes it feels like akira read something and felt like adding it to the next enstars story he had to write LOL. and i’m so curious, how far ahead did he plan some things he ended up revealing about characters?? some reveals were insane slowburns (a big example is the reveal that past kanata had felt empty after forcibly making himself forget things. that took all the way until 2024 to be revealed to us omg), so it’s like…!?!?
but as i said, a lot has changed about enstars since this ask was sent in, and i don’t think akira writes enstars stories anymore. this is my personal speculation, but i don’t really get the impression any of the 2025 stories have been by akira. so lately the thoughts that come to my mind is wondering what he’s been doing lately.

    <title>Answered Question: Favorite Madly In Love Chiaki Moment</title>
    <url>//20250609_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
haiiii! could you tell me your most favorite chiaki moment that made you go “he’s so madly in love nothings gonna stop him” but before gourmet .!! thankyouuuy

Sent and answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

i love how midochia isn’t even mentioned here and i still know it’s about it… so true!
even when not counting gourmet, there’s still way too many favorite scenes… so i tried to instead think about a scene that has kept me afloat when it comes to chiaki’s feelings towards midori. something that has been stuck on my mind for years, like what the Hell did he mean by this.
in which case, it’d be a classic one from climax:

Midori: Basketball courts are small anyway, so it’s really crowded and suffocating with this many people around…


Chiaki: What’s that? You’re in pain, Takamine!? Alright then, let me perform the lifesaving technique I learned from Kanata! I’ll give you oxygen through mouth-to-mouth…☆


Midori: Gaahh!? Get your face away from me, you weirdo! I’ll seriously call the police…!

THIS INSANE SCENE HAS BEEN STUCK IN MY MIND FOR YEARSSSS the fact it happens in the same chapters where it’s established subaru’s jealous of midori for having chiaki all for himself, and midori feeling like he &quot;kept chiaki for himself&quot; is like… uhm… i-is he okay? does he even know what he’s doing?
it’s been the core point of a lot of my old midochia ideas that involve chiaki being in love with midori but Not Realizing He Loves Him Like That. especially since i really enjoyed thinking about chiaki taking forever to realize it’s okay and completely normal/possible to be in love with another guy
now i love how it’s been so many years since climax and this line still ages so well in both &quot;oh yeah, chiaki Is Definitely Obsessed With Midori&quot; and &quot;what the fuck did he even mean by this is he okay&quot; ways like truly. the best chiaki flavors of all. imagine feeling so overwhelmed with loneliness and sadness from graduation that you try to find any random excuse to possibly kiss the junior you poured one whole year of love into. he’s crazy ❤️❤️

    <title>Answered Question: Midori Being Good At Social Media</title>
    <url>//20250611_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Hi! I remember once hearing about Midori being good at using social medias.
Is it because he regularly search people’s opinion on rst/himself/everything Chiaki-related ? I dont remember him using socmeds for anything else haha.

Sent and answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

yeah! in the oshi room, he was tagged as &quot;good with social media&quot; along with shinobu (who’s been said to be good at finding information online), which is absolutely hilarious because the main thing we know about midori and social media is how he regularly searches up about chiaki LMAOO
you’re not missing out on any info, that’s about right!! midori’s thing with social media started since the beginning of !! era year 1, a rough timeline is:


in the summer, he was the reason ryuseitai found out they’re being slandered by rinne live, because he was on his phone looking up crazy:b at the time


this incident made ryuseitai suffer a lot of backlash in the summer, and out of paranoia and worry over ryuseitai, he became unhealthily obsessed with checking online what people are saying about ryuseitai


meanwhile, he’s also been searching up about chiaki (to which he gives any and all excuse for why, namely that &quot;someone has to monitor him&quot;, like alright bro).


he searches up chiaki so often and so well he knows news about him that just came out. he also knows his talk shows well purely through online search ups


eventually by early winter, the bad comments he sees online end up feeding a very unhealthy mindset: they make him even more paranoid on how he and ryuseitai are perceived by the public, but he also can’t get himself to fully stop either


but eventually by late winter, he does attempt to stop looking up social media comments by muting his name and ryuseitai’s name. unknown if he ever muted chiaki’s name though. at around this point, he’s no longer searching as much and is unaware what people are saying online, but has seen enough to be paranoid that they’re probably slandering them again for any move they take publicly


but then ryuseitai unites so hard by the end of supervillain that he kinda stops caring as much and just goes &quot;eh, what can we do about misinfo about us online&quot;


BUT THEN, early !! era year 2, we find out he actually is still being online. but it’s to egosearch chiaki and what chiaki fans are saying about him. doubles down on the reasoning being that someone has to monitor him since chiaki tends to neglect contact when he’s away for work for a long period of time.


this insane series of events has somehow made him get tagged as good at social media. i love him
and now… NEW!! in the new main story about mega stream, ryuseitai discover that midori has a knack for live-streaming (though midori denies this). at first he was very anxious about the thought of being locked up in mega sphere (the blimp) and being filmed 24/7 in public, but by day 3 of the streams he’s apparently managed to get a lot of people interested thanks to his vast knowledge of yuruchara and vegetables/fruits. so that further proves he deserves the tag hehe…

    <title>Answered Question: Thoughts on Chiaki and Subaru in the New Main Story</title>
    <url>//20250611_2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
Hello! I don’t see you talk about the last enst story so, i really want to know your opinions on the last enstars story the part when subaru get conflict and chiaki try to help him!
Since you like subachia too! If this bothering you, you can skip or ignore it! Thank you!

Sent and answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

(this isn’t really a shippy post, and only talks about canon scenes !!)
it doesn’t bother me!! and yes chiaki’s parts in the main story were So Good. it was so pleasantly surprising to have a story showcase ryuseitai excelling so well and chiaki being the one to excel the most out of them, and then of course chiaki using his influence to try and help other people with streams is just ☺️❤️ it felt like gourmet chiaki but this time he has ryuseitai with him from the start, so he’s thriving from day 1, and also this time the people he’s helping aren’t faceless contestants in the program, but other characters we also know and love
as for the subaru and chiaki parts, wow, there’s a lot:


big, big big fan of it being a callback to their moments from the 1st ! era main story. chiaki’s first appearance there was to help subaru and fire his spirit back up. was a big fan of chiaki mentioning it when he was talking about how he wants to save subaru


LOVE subaru’s reasoning for refusing to get chiaki’s help. knowing chiaki would willingly help him, but he doesn’t want to ruin anything for ryuseitai right now (as they’re the top rankers) especially not with slander, since ryuseitai already went through so much of that (and even more tense problems) back in !! era year 1. and because he wants chiaki to WIN (i cried btw). i also feel like this alone showed subaru’s growth over the years, and his trust in chiaki and his capabilities as a hero (especially if you compare it to meteor impact subaru. he’s come so far…)


love the part where keito tries to tell subaru that chiaki wants to help him so why keep refusing his calls/offers to collab. keito even showed subaru a livestream segment dedicated to stretching a hand out to subaru. after keito and subaru talk it out, keito’s like &quot;you’re right he’s probably watching us talk on stream right now actually&quot; and subaru’s like &quot;haha you know we call that being a stalker, right?&quot; LIKE OUGHHHH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK CRAZY CHIAKI I’M SOOOO HAPPY MY BRAIN WAS HAVING A DISCO DANCE AT THIS LINE. THAT’S RIGHT CHIAKI IS SO FREAKISHLY PERSISTENT IT REACHES &quot;STALKER&quot; LEVELS /POSPOSPOSPOS shout out to this even being presented through how he tried chasing down midori everywhere after he ran away


love the part where chiaki comes out of Fucking Nowhere in subaru and esu’s stream and subaru is like omfg didn’t even call him over and he’s here and chiaki’s like WHERE DID I GO WRONG TELL ME 10 THINGS ABOUT ME THAT’S WRONG and subaru’s like ok ok dude you have way too many good things about you so it’s fine to have a few things lacking yeah?? like omg …💞💞


and just overall was very very pleased with chiaki’s role in the story n__n…. the fact even at the end, chiaki was the one up against tori, the top person of the four sky kings… because chiaki was the top ranker in the stream 💞💞💞


i really enjoyed all his scenes so much … n__n happy for the esu and chiaki interactions too… thank you for asking !!

    <title>Answered Question: Older MidoChia Thoughts</title>
    <url>//20250614_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
dunno if you’ve ever thought about older midochia (or even just midori and chiaki separately) and how you think they’ll change over time? like the little things, or just how their relationship’s grown overall?? like esp knowing the differences between them in Ryuseitai first years vs now.. and how predictions used to b the graduation system and whatnot ifykwim lol. anyway i love all your pages and the rest of your ryuseitai thoughts so much!! thank you always for sharing 💚❤️ midochia 4eva

Sent and answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

i’ve thought about them!! still do!! it’s so much fun!! it took me a moment to get what you mean by graduation system, but that’s referring to how in the ! era days, people assumed the 3rd years will graduate school and leave the unit as well, right? i’m still fond of those stories (like in fanfics) to this day, there’s a unique flavor that shows people’s creativity when we still didn’t know the future of these characters 😭💕 for how the fandom used to headcanon their future in the ! era days, i wrote up a small list here!!
for my own ideas… there’s two types: the one that’s PURELY self-indulgent domestic life together (skips how they confess, start dating etc straight to when they’re just together and in love), and the one that’s more &quot;realistic&quot; and actual headcanons of how they’d be years from now (though it can get self-indulgent too)
for the purely self-indulgent path:


midochia live together and go through domestic shenanigans. OR it’s an idea about how they start working towards living together, like finding apartments and such


i tend to envision chiaki as WAAAY more lax, more purely excitable rather than &quot;putting up a strong front&quot; excitable.


used to imagine midori as the one who cooks more often at home, but now that chiaki has his whole cooking era, i see it more as taking turns. chiaki particularly finds it fun to get the chance to feed midori


midori more openly teases chiaki, tries to get reactions out of him (and it works on chiaki) and smiling whenever he sees chiaki flustered or huffy


i’m obsessed with the idea of midori saying stuff like &quot;shush&quot; &quot;dummy&quot; &quot;silly&quot; instead of &quot;shut up&quot; &quot;are you dumb&quot; etc, like he still finds him loud but he expresses it in a more playful, loving manner. but if he’s genuinely annoyed he will drop that &quot;shut up&quot; 😊


chiaki more selfishly clingy, refusing to stop hugging him because he really is that comfortable and safe enveloped in midori’s warmth and scent, while midori is more casually intimate like subconsciously playing with his hair when they’re watching TV


and any other self-indulgent idea like that. i just love throwing all my &quot;would make me sooo happy if chiaki was like this with midori when they’re alone (or vice versa)&quot; ideas into this path.


i found some random tweets where i talk about self-indulgent domestic midochia, so i’ll drop them here to feed the brainworms:

hehehe domestic midochia cooking for each other, splitting chores between each other 🥰🥰🥰 decorating their home with yuruchara and hero figurines… 🥰🥰🥰🥰 they’re meant to be


chiaki humming to himself while cooking… like wow in a domestic setting midori will always 100% know when he’s in the kitchen. just humming all his favorite tokusatsu songs, excited to cook dinner for them after a long day of work ☺️


housespouse chiaki… humming as he cooks food, talking to himself like &quot;you can’t hide from me!&quot; while cleaning every nook and cranny from dust and dirt, happily greeting midori home with a hug (chiaki’s dream come true)… living his best life
he doesn’t even Have to be a housespouse… chiaki finding it so relaxing and fun to do things for the house whenever he has the free time, and gladly sharing his upcoming plans with midori out of excitement and because he wants to know midori’s thoughts hehe…
he just gets to self-indulge and do as he likes once he’s at home!!! it’s his and midori’s apartment, he can be himself 🥰🥰🥰 meanwhile midori brings veggies and groceries over after visiting his home a bit so that they can cook together hehehe… domestic midochia the world

for the &quot;realistic&quot; path:


i like to think ryuseitai will eventually live together, and i like imagining how they’d work in one house/apartment. who cooks, who buys groceries, how do they split the chores… i especially love the idea of them working together on house chores. super domestic and sweet.


ryuseitai loving, caring and supporting each other 24/7 in their careers and lives 💞 ALL THE WHILE midochia are either pining for each other as always or already in a relationship at this point. either work for me because it’s midochia, they’re Insane no matter what their relationship status is


if midochia hasn’t gotten together yet, then kanata and tetora are completely aware the two love each other Like That. shinobu knows they love and care for each other but hasn’t caught on yet that it’s Like That.


regardless of whether they’ve gotten together or not, shinobu is usually on chiaki’s &quot;side&quot; whenever midochia have some new conflict between each other (sympathizing with him), and tetora is usually on midori’s &quot;side&quot; (supporting him because he gets him). kanata is either neutral or switches between the two sides, but he’s usually on chiaki’s side too because chiaki needs way more help when a misunderstanding happens between those two… ☝


if they’re already together, i feel like chiaki would be even more openly clingy than he is now, more openly honest when he’s emotionally hurt, and even MORE messy /pos. he doesn’t look as &quot;senpai-like&quot; as he used to, being way more self-indulgent and just himself when with midori.


midori in his yumenosaki years has always been struggling with his self-worth and capability to Truly change, and a lot of it relates back to his relationship with chiaki (ex, has he been able to properly repay chiaki through his own actions). so for them to actually be in a relationship, i feel like midori has to have figured out his footing and grasped onto his own way of being happy with chiaki. so by this point, midori’s way more naturally bold with his acts of affection, like casually patting his head when chiaki does well, quietly building him a new shelf for his new set of books, etc


midochia continue to have that wacky silly dynamic we all know and love, just with extra flavors of them actually being lovers now. kanata tetora and shinobu are used to it by now like it’s another part of today’s routine for them.


…and just stuff like that!! i think ES2 has already shown us a lot of their potential in the future. like, i thought it’d take a long while to get to see chiaki being openly honest with ryuseitai, but then stella (ES2 story) came out and revealed NOPE he is fully mask down with ryuseitai now, actual baby of the unit. so… i guess future version would just further go down that path heheh 😊


i feel like i don’t think about headcanons as much anymore because ES2 has given me exactly the future ryuseitai i wanted, but it’s still so yummy… especially to think up ideas that only work when they’ve all graduated
i also 100% still stand by this thought:

learning to sew for ryuseitai, joining the audition for ryuseitai, getting himself possessed by his beloved ryuseitai junior, wanting to gift ryuseitai, starting to think chiaki wants a domestic life with all of ryuseitai in one house, and with midori in the same room as him

there’s a random thread i once wrote in the past on how i imagine ryuseitai in the kitchen together, especially in a future setting.
thank you for enjoying my rambles ahh…😭💚❤️

    <title>Answered Question: Ryuseitai’s SEKAI</title>
    <url>//20250614_2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
If ryuseitai had a sekai what do you think it would be like? I’ve been wondering it since the prsk collab and I was thinking maybe it would be a city sekai? Or something like that idrk

Sent and answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

this ask summoned back the proseka collab i’m crying /lh
i really like the idea of a city for their sekai!! especially since most tokusatsus happen in cities and towns, and cities tend to be the &quot;melting pot&quot;, which suits ryuseitai having diverse personalities 😊💞
but i’m sorry, anon… i have…. no thoughts of my own, i feel like you could share more about it than me 😭💔 i haven’t really dipped into proseka long enough to understand its world lore nor how sekai’s work and how they grow and develop… so i haven’t really thought up how a sekai would be for them.
but i asked if a fellow chiakiP would be fine with me sharing their vision, because i really liked it…. so here’s @/RenaiPro’s thoughts on ryuseitai’s sekai! capitalized chunks are from @/RenaiPro, the non-capitalized chunks are my random chip-ins.
&quot;From what I understand, while the person who created the Sekai has the most influence over it over time others who are part of it can end up influencing. So I love the idea of it originally being Chiaki’s, born out of both his desire to be and love of heroes as well as his loneliness and despair. Chiaki’s influences are very obvious at first. But as everyone else joins and as they slowly become a true unit and true friends you see everyone’s influences on the world.
Like it’s originally mostly Chiaki and tiny bits of Kanata. Kanata’s influences slowly growing over time as Ryuseitai becomes his family. As for the juniors, they originally have no influence but once their hearts truly accept Ryuseitai that’s when they start having influence on the Sekai. I also….really love the idea that Midori has no influence on the Sekai until the events of Repayfes….
A little mat you’d see in a dojo popping up for Tetora. A small pond with colorful fishes for Kanata. Midori having no influence adding to his insecurities in Repayfes because “see?! I don’t even influence in the Sekai like everyone else! That’s proof I’m not the same as everyone else!!!&quot; &quot;
&quot;as if it’s proof he should’ve left long ago like tetora said…💔 and the green ranger in the sekai means nothing to him he thinks anyone can replace and be that in his stead 💔&quot;
&quot;Chiaki telling Midori that this Sekai may have been born from Chiaki alone but it was Ryuseitai that nurtured it. It was all five of them together that has made it what it is now. And that while Midori may not SEE his influence on it, it’s still there all the same
And then…after Repayfes when Midori has finally fully devoted himself as a member of Ryuseitai…them going to the Sekai and Midori seeing an adorable little yuruchara plush waiting there…. The other fun thing is to imagine the Ryuseitai Sekai version of the vocaloid characters too since each Sekai gets their own individualized version!
From what I remember at their cores the Sekai versions of the vocaloids are the same, but their personalities are heavily influenced off the one(s) who created the Sekai. In this case going off the idea that the Sekai was born from Chiaki that would mean the vocaloids would all likely represent some aspect of Chiaki’s personality&quot;
&quot;DIBS ON BOOKWORM LEN (no)&quot;
&quot;Heck yeah little bookworm Len (give him glasses too)&quot;
and that’s about all i have to share…! i think it would definitely be so fun and interesting, ryuseitai’s so full of color and personality that there’d be so much to explore!! if you have any thoughts feel free to share, considering we’re about to get proseka x enstars part 2 (global edition)💞

    <title>Answered Question: Chiaki’s Pushiness</title>
    <url>//20250616_1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[
is it just me or is chiaki a lot less pushy now? i don’t know exactly where it started whether it’s his graduation or the events of comet show or what, but like in midori’s FS2 when he wanted to help midori practice but quickly pulled back suggesting midori would probably prefer tetora and shinobu. or like in the wedding event where it happened twice actually! (at first where midori was like ugh im tired and he goes oh okay nevermind then, and then later when he tries to recruit midori for the event)


it’s cute when it happens because we get to see midori pulling him back but also sad that he’s not like he used to be. do you know if this happens more other than the two stories i mentioned?

Sent and answered in June 2025. tweet link of the answer

i’ll do my best to keep this answer simple because the long answer to this is &quot;so about chiaki’s persona vs his true self, and how it relates to the ryuseitai arc as well as his relationship with midori… (i continue for 5k words)&quot;
so: those 2 stories you gave as an example are set in ES year 1, after chiaki graduated and told himself he’ll make ABSOLUTE SURE to give the ryuseitai juniors space now that they’ve grown and have their own responsibilities to fulfill. because of this, there are many moments in the ES year 1 stories where the ryuseitai juniors note how he isn’t as persistent or pushy as they thought, since they’re still used to how he’d behave in ! era.
this is littered in ES1 stories, but two good examples are in motor show, when chiaki was loud and very clingy with the juniors, wanting to talk to them… but then, tetora vents to him about his leader problems. tetora was then surprised when chiaki took a step back from helping him and instead trusted tetora’s word that he’ll manage. after chiaki leaves the juniors, midori notes he was acting odd.
and then later in the epilogue, midori kicks him back on stage right after chiaki monologues to himself how much they’ve all grown and aren’t babies that need caretaking anymore. midori lectures him that he’s still part of ryuseitai so he shouldn’t show an &quot;uncool side&quot; (referring to chiaki hesitating from being part of the spotlight as a hero along with them). chiaki is also A LOT more busy in ES year 1 as a very popular idol, also another reason he wasn’t with ryuseitai as much
there’s also the events of comet show that made him emotionally shut himself off from ryuseitai (by putting all the blame on himself), and that worsened the aforementioned behavior… but it’s kind of in a different way as well, and it’d take a while to get through that layer of chiaki’s distancing. the main thing is that, wedding march and midori FS2 are based on what i just described above!
it’s true, chiaki was extremely pushy and particularly always in midori’s business in ! era. it’s why in midori fs2, midori makes a comment on it:

Chiaki: You’re the only one who’ll stand on the actual stage, but I can help you out with practice anytime, Takamine!
Ah, actually— Would it be easier for you to practice with people your own age instead, like Sengoku or Nagumo…?


Midori: You’ve been pushy this whole time, so please don’t just back out all of a sudden… It throws me off.
…But, right. Morisawa-senpai has always been that sort of person.

but right at the end, he also notes that that’s not &quot;new&quot; per se. this is probably a nod to the very random times chiaki’s backed off at the very last second even though he was pushy the whole time (other than the motor show one i pointed out, climax epilogue 5 also comes to mind)
there are even MORE and MORE layers to talk about this, but i don’t want to overcomplicate the topic too much, so i focused mostly on explaining why he’s like that in those stories.
but it’s not that &quot;he’s less pushy now&quot;, it’s that &quot;he was less pushy&quot;. after ryuseitai talk things out and unite again by the end of supervillain, stories set after it show him being pushy and persistent (i.e. ES year 2 stories). it’s a little different from his ! era days because he’s grown a lot by this point, but BOY, is ES year 2 filled with him being a pushy person ESPECIALLY when it comes to midori. you can tell he finally feels comfortable and doesn’t have to hold back with ryuseitai as much as he thought he did 😊
check out:


supervillain epilogue right at the end, where his pushiness indicates to midori that they’re returning back to their usual selves


tropical reborn ch1 for a pretty classic pushy chiaki moment (invading midori’s room)


he's extremely silly-pushy in the first few MCs of the ryuseitai album trip


honorary mention to gourmet for doing the most insane thing on live television, that inadvertently involved midori with it too (much to his dismay). this one is an accidental &quot;being pushy&quot; as he didn't know he was being filmed, but still counts in how he feels so close to midori now that he gladly does this


and so many other random moments plastered in ES2 stories/content, sometimes fully unrelated to midori and sometimes related to him.
