complete)</p><p>💚&quot;So suffocating… Why'd I join a unit like this… Sigh, this is so depressing… I wanna die…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;What's up, what's wrong!? You've no energy, Green! Raise your voice! Light the fire in your soul! Effort, friendship, victory! A huge explosion with a huge victory! Fuhahaha…! ☆&quot;</p><h3 id="Hero-Show">Hero Show</h3><p>(7, incomplete)</p><p>💚&quot;Ugh, so heavy… It's exhausting to hold you up when you keep moving, Buchou…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hold it, Takamine! I've told you this plenty of times before: When we're wearing these uniforms—in other words, when we've transformed—you have to call me 'Taichou,' not 'Buchou'!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Should I keep holding up Buch—Taichou, or should I throw him off of me to get rid of him…? Which one would be less of a pain…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Don't avoid trouble, Takamine! You should enjoy hardships, and adore the thought of adversity! Fuhahaha! ☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;No, no! Why're you losing heart midway, Takamine!? I've told you this plenty of times before: If you're a man, then do it already!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine was carrying me on his shoulders so that I could fiddle with one of the breakers in the ceiling.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It would take too long to get a ladder, but thankfully Takamine was here instead!&quot;<br>💚&quot;This is the most I can do, really… But I'm honored to know my huge size came to use…♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You know what you're supposed to do, right Takamine? You have to carry me around to recreate action scenes, since we don't have wires!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Not at all… He kept forcing himself out of bed 'cause he thinks he's fine… Transfer student-san and I managed to tie him down to the bed, though…&quot;</p><h3 id="Pirate-Festival">Pirate Festival</h3><p>(1, incomplete)</p><p>❤️(Ohh, Takamine is unusually eager! I always knew he could do it if he tried! What a nice expression! It's what a fighting man looks like! You have that sort of smile too, huh! ☆)</p><h3 id="Tough-Guy">Tough Guy</h3><p>(31, complete)</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine! Do you like gakuran!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;What're you on about all of a sudden…? Also, could you please not casually come to my classroom to hang out…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I had to wear gakuran in middle school, so I do have it at home, but… I grew tall really fast, so I bet it'd be way too tight on me to wear now…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Is that so! That's truly wonderful, Takamine! Keep on growing just like that! Become a man large enough to reach the sun…☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Umm, Morisawa-senpai… I don't get what's up with you, but I'm busy right now, so could you save it for later…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? What are you busy with!? If there's anything I can help with, just let me know!<br>Aren't we comrades in Ryuseitai, Takamine!? All for one, and one for all!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Aren't we comrades in Ryuseitai, Takamine!? All for one, and one for all! That's what Ryuseitai is all about! Fuhahaha!! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;He's seriously suffocating…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm sorry, Anzu-san… If that guy's bothering you, I'll tie him, tape his mouth shut, and lock him in that storage over there, okay…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Whaa!? Like storing away a heater used only in winter!? But sure! Being tied up and confined is what an ally of justice'd go through…♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm always excited to see Anzu-san's next design, so it's been motivating me to work hard in my idol activities lately…♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;A-ha, that's amazing, Anzu! You're getting good at handling Takamine! I really struggled to manage it, y'know!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;My bed is full of Anzu-san's handmade plushies…♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Really!? My bed is full of tokusatsu goods! We're so similar, Takamine! We Ryuseitai are brethren of the same soul! Fuhahaha…!! ☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Uuu, please stop pestering me already… Just what did you come here for? You mentioned something about gakuran…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine! Please listen to me! Show a little more interest in me instead of the mascot character, please…!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ahh, that's right, you were doing stunt work… Not that I really care, but is that why you're injured so often, Morisawa-senpai…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep! Would you like to give it a try? It's really fun! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;No way, it sounds dangerous…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;That's why I've come here for you! You're fine with it, aren't you, Takamine!? Let's band together as one and conquer this hardship side-by-side…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ehhh, you're just doing whatever you like… It sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so could I pass…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so could I pass…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Fuhaha, then I'll throw that pass back at you! If you don't shoot, you won't score! If you don't score, you won't win! Whether it's in basketball or in life! So, Takamine, it's time! Show me your slam dunk…☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;If you don't shoot, you won't score! If you don't score, you won't win! Whether it's in basketball or in life! So, Takamine, it's time! Show me your slam dunk…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Could you please stop saying whatever comes to your mind…? I don't even get what that means… I wanna die…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;We should live our lives with full vigor too, Takamine! Starting with making this mission a success! Let's rush with our heads held high…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Woah—Please don't drag me over with you… I'm used to it by now, so I'm fine with it, but it'll be a bother to Anzu-san, y'know…?&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Ah, Midori-kun! And Anzu-Anego, too! 'Suuup, I hope you're doing well! Thanks for coming all the way here — You're here to help guide Taishou, right!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, Morisawa-senpai just forcibly dragged me here…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine and I rushed to his home to borrow his gakurans from middle school. He kept growing bigger, so he often had to buy a new one. So we found uniforms fitting of our sizes~♪&quot;<br>✨&quot;Huh… Takamin's got it so rough; he always has to deal with all of Chi~chan-senpai's ideas~&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Eek— I'm so sorry… Er, erm, umm…?&quot;<br>✨&quot;Ahaha. Takamin's way too freaked out~&quot;<br>🎸&quot;Takamine was like this the first few times he met Buchou, too~ He'd always say Buchou's terrifying 'cause of how loud he was~ Man, it takes me back. ♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Eep—… No, um… Nobody mentioned anything about wanting to appear, so, err…?&quot;<br>🐉&quot;Haha. This guy's similar to how Morisawa was in the past.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I-Is that so? No— Erm, yeah, it's exactly as Takamine said! It's like we're practicing for a school festival play! Fuhahahaha…!! ☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Um, hold on… What was that about me being similar to how Morisawa-senpai used to be in the past…? I'd like to sue for defamation based on what that means…&quot;<br>🐉&quot;Ahh… My bad, I misspoke. Forget what I said. I'm sure Morisawa'd much rather look cool in front of his juniors.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot; 'Go go, let's go~! Go go, let's go~! I'm cheering for you! Let's work hard together…☆' &quot;<br>💚&quot;Ooh… Morisawa-senpai's pretty good at this…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot; 'Mm—!? Who's there!? Blasted villain — How dare you disturb the peace of our school! I'll be the one to take you down! Woosh— Transform! Cheerleader Red…☆' &quot;<br>💚&quot;He transformed!? Huh!? What kinda school drama is this…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You're up next, Takamine! It's time you try it out…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Eh? Uuu…? B-But I'm not mentally prepared…&quot;<br>🐉&quot;You can do this. You're a man, aren'tcha? Show us what you've got.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Uuu, ermm… Then I guess I'll do my best somehow…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Uu, ermm… Then I guess I'll do my best somehow…? 'O-Ossu. I-I'm Morisawa… Wait, I mean, Takamine Midori… Can I go home now…?' &quot;<br>❤️&quot;You don't sound enthusiastic, cheerleader!? Come on, cheerleader! You've got this…☆&quot;<br>🐉&quot;Why're you cheerin' on the cheerleader, Morisawa?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Whenever there's a photoshoot, I often get scolded and told, 'Quit doing transformation poses! Your arms and legs are so loud!' — But it's completely unintentional! Believe me!&quot;<br>💚&quot;So Morisawa-senpai's mouth isn't the only thing that's loud, even his arms and legs are…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine ran out of gas earlier, so feel free to take a break next to him over there, while the two of you watch over our figures…☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I don't ever challenge myself to try new things, so… I think I kinda appreciate being dragged around and forced to do all sorts of things…? Don't tell Morisawa-senpai, though… He'll get way too ahead of himself…♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Nagumo! Takamine! If you have enough energy to talk, then stand back up! It's time for our rehearsal! Aren't you both boys!? You should yell as hard as you can to the sun! It's a brand new daaaaaaaaaay!! ☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Maybe he's trying to get Kiryu-senpai used to giving his all no matter the setting…?<br>Morisawa-senpai does use his head a little, doesn't he… I remember him doing something similar to me when I first joined Ryuseitai…&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Midori-kun, you come along too! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah, yeah… Don't drag me along with you — you're really starting to resemble Morisawa-senpai, aren't you, Tetora-kun…? Ah~h, man~ What am I doing so early in the morning~? I just had to join such a lousy unit, huh…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;The two of you seem to be in a good mood, huh? Wonderful, just wonderful! Energy is what youngsters are supposed to have! ♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;You're so obnoxious… You're not young anymore, Senpai, and you're being really overbearing, so how about you cut your energy down by half…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;What was that!? I'm still bursting with youth and energy! Tokusatsu's said to be for kids, but it still makes me shed tears! My heart's always like a newborn! You're so cheeky, Takamine! You little~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh… Please stop clinging to me all casually, you're so suffocating…&quot;</p><h3 id="Christmas-Live">Christmas Live</h3><p>(1, incomplete)</p><p>💚&quot;It's so damn cold… I'm so depressed, I wanna die… I seriously miss Morisawa-senpai for some reason… I wonder if that heater is walking around somewhere…?&quot;</p><h3 id="Emperor-s-Return">Emperor's Return</h3><p>(1, incomplete)</p><p>❤️&quot;Hahaha! ☆ Takamine sure is honest huh, oh you~♪&quot;</p><h3 id="Strawberry-Colored-Holiday">Strawberry Colored Holiday</h3><p>(5, incomplete)</p><p>🌻&quot;What's wrong, what's wrong! You don't have enough guts!

This sucks…&quot;<br>💛&quot;You are happy about it too, I can tell! Your face is breaking into a smile~&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;'Chiaki-oniisan' told you that I like mascot characters…?

The infinitely growing great nature! The green flames are the mark of compassion! It's Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;This is more like sketches by a kid rather than a project plan… Ah, but the designs of the kaijuus and monsters are kind of cute…♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Right, right!?

You're trying to come at me instead of giving up. That's what being a boy's all about, you're so cool…☆<br>I won't hold back either, then. Come try and stop me, Takamine…!)</p><p>💚&quot;Ahaha, that was cool? Didn't Morisawa-senpai look way cooler than me, though…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Takamine, complimenting me? Do you have a fever by any chance!? Let's go to the infirmary, we need to have you checked up!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ohh, wonderful! Takamine with his arms raised in front of the hoop gives off an overwhelming pressure! It's just splendid! Just what you'd expect from the 'Takamine Barricade'…☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Well, it's not really uncomfortable or anything… I don't dislike being near him, I think…♪ But don't tell him, okay?

It's embarrassing to be stared at while drawing~&quot;<br>💚&quot;Me… like Morisawa-senpai…?

I'm intrigued! But I'd rather you refrain from doing that for now!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Fuhaha! You guys should also change into your uniforms and join us! Let's have a final showdown! Come on now, let me feel your growth firsthand…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm… Sounds tiring, so I'll pass… I'm annoyed enough that you dragged me here when I'm not even the type to go to parties…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You should join us, Takamine.

Huh!? Morisawa-senpai!?<br>W-Why's he just standing in the corner, all spaced out…? I almost let out a weird sound 'cause I thought I saw a ghost…)</p><p>❤️&quot;………&quot;<br>💚(Huh…? Is he… crying…? His shoulders are shaking… and I can hear muffled sobs, too… Huh? What's going on…? Why's he crying all alone in the gym in the middle of the night…?)</p><p>💚(Huh? What's going on…?

You're always laughing and yelling about stuff that makes no sense… You're always over-enthusiastic and constantly bothering everyone with everything you do, aren't you…?<br>It's not like you to sob like that… You know that, right, Senpai?)</p><p>❤️&quot;…Hmm? Ohh, that surprised me! So it was you, Takamine! What's up, what's wrong!? Are you on your way home? You shouldn't stay around for so long, y'know!

Wait for me, I'll be ready soon!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Heh! ♪ Just to let you know, I was cleaning the gym as thanks for all the wonderful memories it gave me the past three years! Showing our gratitude is important, Takamine! Both as a hero and an idol!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai. ……Is everything alright?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? Is what alright? I don't know what you're referring to, but worry not, Takamine! My engines are always at full throttle for the sake of protecting the peace of the world! Fuhahaha…!! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;…I see.&quot;</p><p>💚(Ahh… I wonder why I feel this way…? He hasn't done anything wrong… But seeing him smile irritates me to no end for some reason…<br>Morisawa-senpai, why're you smiling…? You, who loves everyone and is loved by everyone in return… How can you even be smiling right now…?)</p><p>💚(Graduation is supposed to be something upsetting, so agonizingly lonely and sad… Yet, are you really gonna try and look cool while parting ways, until the very end…?<br>No… Even before all this, you've always been—…)</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine? Heeey, what's wrong? Are you feeling down? You're a handsome guy, so seeing you all silent and blank-faced is terrifying!&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, not really… I'm just a little tired, sleepy, and irritated…&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;And like, today… From what I could tell, Chi~chan-senpai and Takamin were both acting a little off. So since I was kinda worried, I tried my best to talk to them, but… I'm just not good at that sorta stuff.&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;It's kinda hard to say goodbye with a smile, though~ Takamin is terrible at smiling, for one thing. On the other hand, Chi~chan-senpai's smiling a lot more than he used to last year. …Aren't those two kinda similar?&quot;<br>🎸&quot;Really? I personally think they're the exact opposite…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Nagumo. I don't want to think you would, but did you hit Takamine by any chance? You shouldn't resort to violence!&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Please don't just assume things. I wouldn't hit him. …I'd only dirty my fists if I punched a spoiled brat like him.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;D-Did someone get hurt after all…? Nagumo seems to be unharmed, so is Takamine the one who got hit? I'll help patch him up! Stand up, Takamine! Show me where it hurts! I often get injured during my stunt work, so I know how to treat small injuries!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ugh, you're so loud… I'm not injured anywhere, okay… You're all panicking way too much…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Then why are you crying? Anzu, Sengoku, please give me a full report of what happened!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;You never wanted to become an idol in the first place, right, Midori-kun? So scolding you so harshly, pushing you to do stuff, and forcefully dragging you back in when you're so unmotivated would just be cruel. That's exactly what Taichou always did, though.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Taichou would always pretend to be a terrible, insensitive person — giving you pep talk after pep talk, and pulling you on stage even though you hated it. That became an everyday occurrence in Ryuseitai.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;But I was wrong. Y'know, I really can't do what Taichou does. I just don't have it in me to sacrifice myself for another person's sake — especially if it meant I'd be hated and found annoying 'cuz of it.<br>I can't do all'a that just to drag Midori-kun along by force.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;But y'know, Midori-kun… Let me ask you something! Exactly what was this whole year to you?<br>Taichou went to pick you up every day! He was always there to help you get through the day, even though you had zero motivation!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Taichou went to pick you up every day! He was always there to help you get through the day, even though you had zero motivation! Did all'a that effort he spent, running around and encouraging you, just go to waste?&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Taichou completely used up his last precious year in high school just to try and hone our skills, y'know! Are you saying all'a that was just a waste of time?&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;I was hoping that you were just embarrassed, that deep down it might've all meant somethin' to you! But if you're telling me that it was all just a waste, that you really meant it when you said you hated everything and wanted to die…<br>Then what was Taichou's whole year for!?&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;I know that nobody asked Taichou to do any of that — that he's the one who decided to do all of that on his own — If that's what you're thinking, it's true! But the way you've been acting is just too much!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Taichou was expecting so much from you! You, who's so much more talented than me! So much more handsome than me! To be honest, as one of your classmates, it makes me super jealous!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;I wish I could've been born to look like you! I'm sure Taichou feels the same way! We were so envious and so captivated by you! We wanted to see you shine even more! But all along, were we just pushing our own selfish wishes onto you?&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;If that was really the case — If you really hated it that much—! You should've left before you ate away an entire year of Taichou's life! You should've quit everything and just disappeared!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Our seniors helped you so much, and you owe 'em so much, but you refuse to pay that back? Just 'cuz you can't bother yourself to do something you don't like?<br>Hey, Midori-kun… Just how long do you plan to keep being a little brat!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;…Takamine. I want to hear how you truly feel. I won't know if you don't say anything. Was it really all a nuisance? Did I really just cause you suffering throughout this whole year?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;If so, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll give you a proper apology, and I'll do anything I can to make it up to you.<br>I won't mind if you think of our meeting as nothing but an unfortunate accident and forget it ever happened.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I won't mind if you think of our meeting as nothing but an unfortunate accident and forget it ever happened.<br>If that's what would give you relief and make you smile again, then I'm fine with that… because your smile is the greatest treasure in this whole world.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;…Because your smile is the greatest treasure in this whole world.<br>I would always look forward to making that shine at its brightest. But if I was truly just a nuisance to you all along, then… I apologize. I'm so sorry, Takamine.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm pretty sure I've always said this before, though… That you're annoying, that I don't wanna do any of it, that it's all a pain… But you never, ever listen…<br>Morisawa-senpai… Is there really anything worthwhile about me…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I thought the same thing would happen with you… I thought you'd get disappointed and lose all interest in someone like me… Something like that is only natural… That's why I always had an escape ready…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I thought you'd get disappointed and lose all interest in someone like me… Something like that is only natural… That's why I always had an escape ready… The only notable thing about me is my appearance… There's no way anyone could ever love me for who I really am…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;And yet, you go ahead and put all your hopes into someone pathetic like me!<br>I feel like a horrible, miserable person for making Morisawa-senpai waste a whole year of his life on me!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Did you know? Morisawa-senpai was so upset about leaving that he cried all alone where no one could see him! But he intended to hide those tears from us to the very end! He wanted to say goodbye with a smile, as a hero — and to leave us with nothing but happy memories!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;He wanted to say goodbye with a smile, as a hero — and to leave us with nothing but happy memories! Are you insane!? That's way too cool! What are you, some kind of saint!?<br>And I—! I wasted an entire precious year of someone as amazing as that…!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Good morning! Excuse me, I'd like vegetables! Anything is fine, as long as it isn't eggplants!&quot;<br>💙&quot;good mooorning~ i would like some fish~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh!? What are you two doing…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Umm… Repayment Festival has already started… Are you sure it's okay not to go and support Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun…? They're doing their very best to repay you, y'know…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep! Of course we plan to go and support them!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;This always happens since Yumenosaki is so nearby… Every time there's a big DreamFes going on, I'm also dragged around to do work all over…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mhm, so it seems. I talk to your parents often, so I'm aware of that.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You really do have normal parents. So it doesn't sink in when explaining to them that their son is now a popular idol.<br>My parents are the same. When I tell them that I've got a lot of tough jobs, they always reply with something like 'Look at you, sounding like an adult! ♪'&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;But don't you want to prove to your parents that you've become an adult despite that? Don't you want to show them how much you've grown?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Umm… What do you mean…? I don't really get what you're trying to say…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Right now, in Yumenosaki, there's work that only you can do. So go now and do it. That's all I can say — all I can ask of you.<br>I'm in no position to forcibly pull you by the hand anymore, so all I can do now is hope, like how one puts hope upon a shooting star.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm sure there are a lot of other juniors who wanna say their thanks to you as well, not just Ryuseitai… I feel really bad, making you two waste your time on me…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Takamine.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Fweh—? Huh!? What is it!? Your face is way too close! You're always like this…!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Fweh—? Huh!? What is it!? Your face is way too close! You're always like this…!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Sorry. You never react much, so I always end up thinking you couldn't hear me well.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;If you don't like my face being this close, then reply back. At least go &quot;yeah&quot; or &quot;mhm&quot; back.<br>Don't ignore me, it feels lonely.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Don't worry, I won't say anything that'd hurt you. Though I suppose you're thinking that's just a load of garbage, especially after all the stress that I've put you through.&quot;<br>💚&quot;………&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You have to go now, they're all waiting for you. …Leave this place to us.&quot;<br>💚&quot;But…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Takamine. I was a sickly child, so I always caused trouble for my family. That's why I wanted to be a great idol — to earn money and make things easier for my parents.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;That was the reason at first. That's how everyone is at first. People aren't always aiming to be an idol because of a big dream or ideal. That's why, Takamine, there's no need to look down on yourself.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Dreams don't even come true most of the time — though I could never say that in front of children, even if they pried my mouth open.<br>Everyone's like that, it isn't just you… Takamine.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine. The reason I tried to make Ryuseitai into a strong unit was because… I wanted to be able to say I was the leader of a veteran unit.<br>I wanted to earn high marks for this unit, so that I could use it to my advantage when I graduate. That's how it was at first.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You're a considerate person, Takamine, so benefiting from the unit's value… might have felt wrong for you. But it isn't something to feel guilty about at all. That's what units are for.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Units exist so that, together, we can climb up to a place we wouldn't be able to reach on our own. It's the same with you, Takamine; there's no need to feel guilty at all.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Was this year you spent with Ryuseitai not fun for you? Was it nothing but a pain? Was it only irritating? Were you always unhappy? If not, then you shouldn't be staying here!<br>Run! Run now, Takamine! Isn't there something only you can do for the sake of your beloved friends!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;This is the last time I'll act like your superior and lecture you like a know-it-all! So don't ignore me! Listen to me!<br>I'm begging you, Takamine, please go save my beloved comrades! Both Nagumo and Sengoku are still struggling! They're in grave danger and need your help!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;So go now! Run, Takamine! It's the hero's turn to shine! Your filler arc is over now, so go fight for the sake of your world's peace!<br>Gooo, Ryusei Green! Make our wishes come true…!!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Umm… As usual, nothing you say makes any sense… or it's like you're shouting with so much energy that I have no idea what's going on… But I guess I've gotten used to it… I sort of get what you're trying to say…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…I'll go to Yumenosaki. I don't know what I can do, but… I've been encouraged all the way to this point—If I cower back… If I run away now, I really will end up looking way too uncool.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yes! You're a good boy, Takamine! Hang in there, hero! Don't lose now, hero…!! ☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Yes! You're a good boy, Takamine! Hang in there, hero! Don't lose now, hero…!! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Don't shout… See, now people are probably wondering what's going on and looking at us… There's gonna be rumors now… so depressing…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;If people start saying bad things to the point where I can't live here anymore… then please take responsibility, Morisawa-senpai…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep! Leave it to me, I'm always welcome! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Does this guy even know what he's saying…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Is it really okay to leave the greengrocer to you two…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yes. Your family and I have already talked it over. They accepted and supported it. They even apologized since they felt like they've given you a lot of grief. They're good people. Cherish them well, Takamine.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;First things first: try to do your very best as an idol. If you ever lose track of your path, or can't progress any further, then come back here. Your family will always be here to welcome you back.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You have a tough, yet warm family. So what exactly is dissatisfying for you, Takamine? What's so 'depressing'!? What's making you 'want to die'!? Is this really the time to be dying!? Enjoy your life to the fullest, just like your family wants you to!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;What's so 'depressing'!? What's making you 'want to die'!? Is this really the time to be dying!? Enjoy your life to the fullest, just like your family wants you to!<br>Promise me that. This is my wish right now, so please make it come true, Ryuseitai.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Promise me that. This is my wish right now, so please make it come true, Ryuseitai.&quot;<br>💚&quot;You're still part of Ryuseitai, aren't you…? So will you make my wish come true, too…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? I don't mind, tell me anything! I'll do what I can!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're still part of Ryuseitai, aren't you…? So will you make my wish come true, too…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? I don't mind, tell me anything! I'll do what I can!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Then please make sure you two come back to Yumenosaki later, okay?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Then please make sure you two come back to Yumenosaki later, okay? Repayment Festival is for saying thanks to our seniors, so if you're not there, it'll be a little awkward… And from what I understood from Anzu-san, we may have a present for you that you'll enjoy a lot…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Aren't we supposed to be the ones to give Anzu something on White Day?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yes… That's all the more reason why you have to come to the live show… It's something even Anzu-san would enjoy; an unbelievable unfolding of events straight from a tokusatsu awaits you…♪&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;Heheh, Chi~chan-senpai's number one favorite may be Takamin and all, but… It still does frustrate me a little that Takamin gets to have everything for himself. And it looks like he's gonna become the exact kinda hero Chi~chan-senpai hoped for…&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;It looks like Takamin's gonna become the exact kinda hero Chi~chan-senpai hoped for, so… maybe I should become the exact kinda idol Chi~chan-senpai hoped for.<br>That'll be our repayment to him, and today will mark the memory of that first step.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ryusei Kiiick~♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Fuhaha! Worry not, Takamine! The greengrocer store is also thriving! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ughh, there you go again with doing needless—… You're always like this… I guess I can't really complain though, not when you did it in my place…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ahaha, you're sounding like a leader…♪&quot;<br>🖤&quot;You got a complaint 'bout that? Ah, could it be that you wanted to be the next Ryusei Red?<br>You've always been real close with Taichou, after all… It wouldn't be strange if you've been thinking of inheriting that color all along.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;The red flame is——Gwah!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;……&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Huh? Um, Takamine? Why did you kick my butt? Did I do something wrong!? Are you angry!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Hmph… Well, I do dislike the way you're walking on eggshells around me… You don't have to worry so much, jeez… You're way too late for that…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai. I'll at least be honest with you now. I owe you a lot for this whole year.<br>You may have always been annoying, suffocating, clingy, gross, loud, unpleasant, troublesome, and really gross, but—&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You said it twice! You said 'gross' twice!!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;But. I think I was also an unpleasant junior who was always lazy and kept snapping back… So, well… Let's just call it even.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;All the kindness you've given me — Even if I spent my whole life trying, I don't think I could ever fully return the favor. But at the very least, I'll prove to you that your year didn't go to waste.<br>Thanks to you, even I've changed a little… and I'll show that to you now.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;When we first met, you asked me, 'Won't you become a hero?'<br>And I never gave you an answer… But now I'll answer you not with words, but with actions.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Even if I did say it with words, you wouldn't listen anyway…… So please watch my transformation closely.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ah! That's Kuuga! That's Kamen Rider Kuuga's line!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Shut it.&quot;</p><p>❤️(Takamine.<br>Ahaha, you finally properly introduced yourself… Even though you always said it was too embarrassing and you didn't get it… You whined that you didn't want to do it, only doing it as you pleased…<br>So that's your answer, Takamine. Ahh, I'm glad. I'm so relieved.)</p><p>❤️(Ahaha… No good, I really didn't want to cry until after graduation, not in front of the kids at least… But my vision is getting blurry already.)<br>💚&quot;Hey, come on… This isn't the time to be crying, please finish what you have to do. We'd like to hear your usual catchphrase.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Hey, come on… This isn't the time to be crying, please finish what you have to do. We'd like to hear your usual catchphrase. Please shine in your own way, as you always have—within the center of everyone.<br>I never really disliked seeing that… Morisawa-senpai.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Please shine in your own way, as you always have — within the center of everyone. I never really disliked seeing that… Morisawa-senpai.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I see, so that's how it was all along… That's good, I'm glad. Ahh, I'm just so glad.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I truly feel rewarded. To be a hero means to not ask for anything in return… but if I've been loved and thanked, and brought a smile to someone who was crying—<br>Then there was value and reason to the desperate fight it took to reach here after all.<br>Thank you.&quot;</p><h4 id="Produce-Courses">Produce Courses</h4><p>❤️&quot;Mm, I can't believe Takamine saw me that day… I'm embarrassed at how hard I tried to put up a front to be cool… It actually makes me look pathetic instead, doesn't it…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I saw something I shouldn't have seen… I dunno what I'm supposed to do in times like these… I wish I could just erase my memory of it entirely…&quot;<br>🎀&quot;What was it?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Um, I saw someone crying, even though he's never the type to…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I saw something I shouldn't have seen… I dunno what I'm supposed to do… I wish I could just erase my memory of it entirely…&quot;<br>🎀&quot;What was it?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ah, um… I don't think I can tell others… It might've been my imagination anyway… I'd rather keep this to myself for now.&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;It's because of everyone's bonds!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Of course! They're my comrades who fought alongside me for a whole year, after all!<br>—I bet that's what Morisawa-senpai would say… Something must be wrong with me if I really imitated him of all people…&quot;</p><h3 id="Sparkly-First-Years">Sparkly First Years</h3><p>(10, incomplete)</p><p>💚&quot;I actually wanted to go home straight away, but I didn't want Morisawa-senpai invading my life all the way back home… so I figured he'd be satisfied enough if I played basketball with him…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;The moment I entered the school, Morisawa-senpai came to my classroom and yelled stuff like, 'Ossu! My name is Morisawa Chiaki, and I'm the captain of the Basketball Club! Starting today, you'll be joining us at the club! It's nice to meet youuu~♪'…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;He was so insistent to get me to join the club that I was starting to get tired of refusing him every time…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I figured he'd finally stop invading my classroom if I joined the Basketball Club, and for a moment, I was relieved… until he was like, 'Takamine, won't you become a hero? You've got the qualities of a hero! I'm certain of it, you're meant to be!'&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Now he always comes to my classroom, no matter if it's during lunch break, after school, or whatever else… I'm so depressed, I wanna die…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ughhh, the noisy guy's back…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Wait, hold on a moment! I know something we can practice with just the two of us~♪ You're a beginner at basketball, right? Then I'll just have to show you aaall the ropes…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;No thanks. That's honestly the last thing I'd ever wanna do.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Umm, Morisawa-senpai. Can I seriously not go home…? My parents will yell at me if I don't get back soon…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Oh, is it that late already? That's too bad—I was really hoping we could deepen our bonds today!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Yeah, what a relief… There's unit practice tomorrow, right…? Can I skip it?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yeah, no.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Good morning, comrades~♪ The weather feels so refreshing today…☆ Mhm, my luck sure is perfect! I got to see Takamine and Sengoku early in the morning!&quot;<br>💚&quot;And my luck's hit rock bottom just now…&quot;</p><h3 id="Biblio">Biblio</h3><p>(1, incomplete)</p><p>💚&quot;I get nervous just remembering that glasses-vice-president is an upperclassman or part of the Student Council… Whenever Morisawa-senpai does something dumb, he scolds him with a death glare…&quot;</p><h3 id="Shooting-Star-Festival">Shooting Star Festival</h3><p>(3, incomplete)</p><p>❤️&quot;Sorry for keeping you all waiting! C'mon, Takamine, don't cling to the door; get inside!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Uuu… I was falling back to sleep in my air-conditioned room when Morisawa-senpai loudly woke me up from bed… and then I got dragged all the way here…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine, no! Didn't I say I wanted to talk this out with everyone? You're included in that 'everyone'. Make sure you participate, alright?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Your face's way too close! Uuu, you don't have any proper sense of distance… Please move away, it's seriously suffocating…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Wh—Please don't try to hug me. You stink of sweat, 'kay…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ha ha ha, sorry! I was working under the sweltering hot sun, and it's easy to sweat even when you're standing still. The sweat after a nice workout feels good, y'know! ♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Um, I don't need that sportsy energy…&quot;</p><h3 id="Sweet-Halloween">Sweet Halloween</h3><p>(46, complete)</p><p>💚&quot;You seem down lately, Morisawa-senpai… What's wrong…? I mean, usually it's depression with me, but it can't be something like that with you, right…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Umm, so basically, we'll be staying at school all day? I live nearby, so it's not like I'd miss out on much if I just slept at my own home instead…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;If that's more comfortable for you, then it's fine, Takamine.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Is yours alright, too, Takamine? You mentioned that you grew taller recently, right?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ah, yeah, it's alright… The outfit's made of stretchy material, anyway…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Is it just me, or is Morisawa-senpai acting weird lately…?&quot;<br>💛&quot;Is he not always weird?&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, like… he's not acting like himself… It's like he's always scared of something… He seems so nervous that he's overwhelmed… He doesn't even pester me as much as he used to…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;He doesn't even pester me as much as he used to…&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Oh? Could it be that you're feeling lonely~? 'Cuz he's not paying attention to you~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;……&quot;<br>💛&quot;Wh—!? What are you going to do with that hammer, Midori-kun!? You could kill someone with that, you know!?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;But no, really… Hasn't Morisawa-senpai been kinda off…?&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Yeah, now that you mention it… He has been a li'l quieter than usual lately. He hasn't been his usual positive self… I mean, he didn't seem pumped up 'bout participating in the Halloween Party, either.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Oh yeah, he never even mentioned Halloween Party until Tetora-kun asked him whether we'd be joining it, right…? He'd usually be excited to get things going, and poke his nose in everyone else's business… Like, that's how we got ourselves involved with Quarrel Fes, right…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;If we keep going at our current pace, it'll look like we were slacking off! So let's do our best! Let's go, we can do it! Put all your energy into it! Fuhaha!! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm…? He really is acting weird… Or like, he's trying really, really hard to seem as energetic as possible…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;My beloved comrades! What are you all doing over in that corner? Let us take part in it, too~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Eughhh, here comes the loud one…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Besides, uh, there's no TV in the dojo! So you can't watch a movie, right!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;That's okay, I brought over what we need… There was an extra monitor in the AV room, and I got permission to use it…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Gahhh!? You really are amazing, Takamine…! So kind and strong…!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Yeah, aren't you the one who always forces us to watch tokusatsu shows so we can learn how to act more heroic…? It's the same as that… What, do you have a problem or something?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;N-No? Nope, none at all! Quite the opposite! It's wonderful that you're all working so hard!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ah! My bad! I-I think I've gotten sleepy too! Can I go and get some rest? Is it okay if I do that!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Oh no no… Don't be like that~ Let's all watch the movie together…♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;T-Takamine? Your face looks mischievous! Why's that!? Did I do something to make you angry again!?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Weaknesses…? So Morisawa-senpai really is bad with scary stuff…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;O-Of course not! There's nothing a hero's afraid of! Ahh, I'm so excited~! We're going to watch a horror movie~! Come on, let's get the movie started!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Yeah, I totally know what you mean… That's how you know the character's gonna die…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;H-He won't die, right!? He survived this long! You're just lying when you say he's gonna die, right!?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Heeey, Morisawa-senpai…? Come on out from under your blankets~ You're being rude to the movie makers by missing out on the climax, y'know~? ♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;No! It's scary! I don't wanna see any more blood and guts!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;No! It's scary! I don't wanna see any more blood and guts!&quot;<br>💚&quot;You always force us to watch hero stuff when we never even wanted to, though…? So there's no reason why you should be the only one to get away with saying that, right…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;U-Uuu! It hurts when you say that!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;(whispering) So you really are bad with horror, Morisawa-senpai… That's why you don't seem to like Halloween either, right…? Since it has lots of monsters…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Uuu~? No, you're wrong! I'm fine! Horror movies don't scare me one bit!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Then why exactly're you tugging on my sleeve and shaking in fear…? Wait a sec… Didn't you yell 'It's scary!' just now…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;N-No! You misunderstand, Takamine! 'Sca-ree' in Swahili means 'really interesting'!&quot;<br>💚&quot;In Swahili…? I can't wait to see what your next excuse will be…♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Anyway, there really isn't anything to be embarrassed about… We all have things we can't stand… In a way, it's more embarrassing and uncool to keep insisting that you like something you actually hate…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It's natural to have dislikes… Just be true to yourself… Aren't you the one who's always telling me stuff like, 'I love you no matter what'…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;? What was that, Takamine? Sorry, I can't hear you very well from under the blankets!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Nevermind… It wasn't important, so…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It feels like Morisawa-senpai gets really anxious without you around… So please don't just disappear out of nowhere…&quot;<br>💙&quot;fufufu, that is because chiaki is more spoiled than you would expect. but it looks like it will be okay, since it seems like midori is protecting him.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;…Eeek!! Something just creeped down my back!! S-Something cold! I'm scared! It's scary! I'm scared!!&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's the air conditioning… We made sure to decorate around the vents without blocking them, remember…? Seriously, are you gonna be alright for this…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Seriously, are you gonna be alright for this…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I-I-I-I'm fine! Ghosts don't exist! They're just something people see when they're half asleep!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahaha… Morisawa-senpai's acting just like a little kid at a haunted house…♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai, you really are bad with monsters, huh…? I'm not really good with them either, but seeing someone who's more afraid than me ends up making me feel calm instead…♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Here you go… We're going to have a live show at the concert hall, so please come over and watch if you can…♪&quot;<br>🖤&quot;C'mon, Taichou! You gotta give out candy and advertise! Look, even Midori-kun's working hard for once!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;S-S-Sorry! But I really can't handle scary things…!&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;Of course, I see my seniors as people I should respect and aim to be like, anyway! ♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ehh~… So you even respect Morisawa-senpai, Sengoku-kun…? I don't see what anyone could find respectable about him this time around, though…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Like, seriously… so what if you're scared of ghosts… If you just told us about it faster, we could've avoided being worried over nothing… We would've just thought, 'Wait, that's it?', laughed it off, and called it a day…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh! So you were worried about me, Takamine! That makes me happy! I was a little nervous that you might not care about me, since you always act so harshly towards me, but in the end, you really do love me as a comrade! ☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I was a little nervous you might not care about me, since you always act so harshly towards me, but in the end, you really do love me as a comrade! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;……&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Wh—!? T-Takamine? Takamine-kun, could you please not shove that giant eyeball in my face…?&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;fufu, do not bully chiaki so much, midori~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mhm… But I just wanna get a tinsy bit more of my revenge for all the times he's pestered me…♪&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Ahaha, the two's positions are completely switched around this time~&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Uuu… Dr. Shinigami is super scary… The air he gives off feels so intense that it's just terrifying.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahaha… Yeah, liking something doesn't mean you'll love every single thing about it… I'm like that, too… I'm not gonna be okay with anything just 'cause it's a mascot…&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;We apologize for taking so long to arrive. Taichou-dono kept trying to flee whenever he saw a monster on the way over here~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah… It was seriously a pain just getting here…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I'm so, so sorry! I haven't been able to do anything right during this event!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ahaha, it's unusual for Morisawa-senpai to be useless, but I feel like I got to be useful instead… I got a lot of attention from the guests, and they kept asking me to take pictures with them…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing a costume, but I didn't feel embarrassed about it, either…♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep! It's just a regular costume for this event, but! Whenever we shout 'Transform!', we are reborn into a new being!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Heheh~♪ I'm so happy to know you got to understand what heroes are, Takamine!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Why're you talking like you're so wise… You're looking really pathetic right now, so nothing you say sounds even the tiniest bit convincing, 'kay…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Why're you talking like you're wise… You're looking really pathetic right now, so nothing you say sounds even the tiniest bit convincing, 'kay…? Please get things done heroically, alright? At least before the live show ends…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Alright! Leave it to me! Justice will prevail…!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ahh, I see now… There were zombie dogs in some of the movies we watched with everyone…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Wha— Don't remind me! Eeek—!! I still can't get the image out of my head! The window…! There's a hand on the window…!?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Wow, that's kinda cute… That sort of thing is just like Ra*bits…♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Really? I find that super scary! Moving stuffed toys are terrifying!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;We gotta work just as hard, too, Midori-kun~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah… But I'm starting to feel tired all of a sudden… Those two weeks were rough… I'm also tired from worrying so much about how off Morisawa-senpai was acting…</p><p>🖤&quot;Heheh, Taichou was pretty much useless this time, but Midori-kun's been making up for it by shining way more than usual. We surprisingly always balance ourselves out.&quot;</p><h4 id="Produce-Courses-2">Produce Courses</h4><p>💚&quot;Ahh… I had nothing to do, so I practiced free throws… 'Cause there was a ball here… Mm? I'm enjoying my youth?<br>Uu, please don't, Anzu-san… Associating every little thing to 'youth' reminds me of a certain somebody, and I don't like it…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ahh, you want to know if we decided on a Halloween costume…? We haven't yet… We literally just started, if anything…<br>But if this were the usual, Morisawa-senpai would've gladly told us lots of ideas… More specifically, he would've pushed his opinions on us…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm~ I'm not really sure, but… Morisawa-senpai has been acting kinda strange lately… Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun say that's the usual for him, but… Sooomething about it doesn't feel right to me, if you get me…? Well, whatever, I guess…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;I'll come over to check how things are going again.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahh… Did I make you worry…? I'll be fine, probably… My motivation isn't that low or anything. If anything, it's Morisawa-senpai who seems out of it, so please come check up on him…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I asked Tetora-kun to teach me how to do Kenpo moves, and I used it on Morisawa-senpai to motivate him to work hard… That was a good time…♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Yeah, I hope the juniors felt something! No, I'll believe in it…☆ Mhm, mhm. I feel like I was endlessly teased throughout the sleepover party, but I'll believe in them!<br>Especially Takamine.

Am I remembering things wrong…?<br>Maybe I should double-check when I'm done, just in case… Since Morisawa-senpai gets really annoying when I skip out on the club…)</p><p>💚(Hmm~… The number on the uniform is four… Which means this is Morisawa-senpai's, I guess… But he's not really the type to just go home without tidying up after himself… Maybe he just went to the bathroom…?)</p><p>💚&quot;Hmm… This is some student's notebook… The handwriting is super cluttered… Whose is this…?<br>Geh—This is Morisawa-senpai's notebook…?”</p><p>💚(I don't get what it's trying to tell me… It's starting to hit its paws on the notebook's photo of Morisawa-senpai for some reason…? Yeah yeah~… Get 'im~ Punch him real good~…♪)</p><p>💚(Hm… The doggie slipped into Morisawa-senpai's uniform and started playing with the ball… Looks like it's having fun… It kinda reminds me of someone I know… Wait—Could it be…?)<br>&quot;Um… I honestly doubt it, but… are you Senpai…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Um… I honestly doubt it, but… are you Senpai…? Ahh—! I told you not to bark! Was that a 'yes'…?<br>No way… That kind of magic doesn't exist in real life… Then again, a book I borrowed from the library had a story like that… But… Ehhh…? Ughh… I guess it could exist…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Um… Tell me if I'm right, okay…?<br>Morisawa-senpai, did you transform into a dog…?&quot;</p><p>💚(Crap… I just stuffed Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog) into my cardigan without thinking… It's struggling around for air… The Vice President is gonna get suspicious…)</p><p>💚(Ehhh…? The health department is coming…? No, this is awful timing! They'll euthanize Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog) if they find him…!?<br>No, that's just too much…… I have to save him…)</p><p>💚(T-That was a ridiculously heroic rescue scene just now… And I didn't even save a cute heroine or anything, it was just a dog… This whole situation's so weird…… Ughhh, what am I gonna do now…?)</p><p>💚&quot;Hm…? What's wrong, Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog)…? You sound like you're whining… Are you… worried about me…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're always like this, aren't you… Even though you're the one who's in hot water here, after turning… transforming…? into a dog…<br>You're always, always worrying and fussing over other people all the time…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're always, always worrying and fussing over other people all the time… That's why I think it'd be terrible if something bad happened to you… Um, like… I can't put it into words well, but… It just wouldn't be fair…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It'll be okay… I'll do something about this, so don't worry… For now, I'll keep you safe at my house until the health department's gone…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'll do something about this and turn you back to normal… Back to your silly, peaceful daily life…<br>So don't look so anxious… Everything will be okay… There, there…♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Uhya—Ahaha… Please don't lick me just 'cause you're a dog now… The moment I remember it's actually Morisawa-senpai in there, it starts to feel really gross…♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Heheh, I'm feeling hungry after running all the way here… It's noon by now, so it's time for some lunch anyway… You'll have eggplants for lunch, Morisawa-senpai… Just kidding~♪<br>I'm kidding, I'm kidding… You hate eggplants, after all…&quot;</p><p>💚(Huh…? Morisawa-senpai(-looking dog) is happily sniffing the eggplant… and licking it…? That's weird… He always freezes up at the sight of eggplants…<br>Maybe turning into a dog made his taste buds change…? Huh…? Have I made a huge misunderstanding right from the start…?)</p><p>💚&quot;Hah… Um, so this dog really isn't Morisawa-senpai, huh…?&quot;<br>✨&quot;…? Why're you bringing up Chi~chan-senpai? I don't get what you mean, but this here's Daikichi!&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;By the time I got back, I heard you'd taken Daikichi away, so I had to come here for him!&quot;<br>💚&quot;B-But he had Morisawa-senpai's notebook and uniform for some reason…?&quot;<br>✨&quot;Ahh, Chi~chan-senpai was also practicing with me! We've been there together since this morning!&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;Takamin, you smell like Chi~chan-senpai, so Daikichi might've thought the stuff belonged to you…?&quot;<br>💚&quot;I smell like that guy…? N-no……&quot;<br>✨&quot;Well, don't you? Since he's always hugging you!&quot;</p><h3 id="Boarding-Live">Boarding Live</h3><p>(4, incomplete)</p><p>❤️&quot;Mm? Do ships not interest you, Takamine? You looked really motivated back at PirateFes though, didn't you? I thought it's because you got to perform on a ship, but was I wrong?&quot;<br>💚&quot;That's just 'cause I had a reward, yuruchara to be specific…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Uu… Just hearing the word 'luxury cruise ship' feels nerve-racking…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Worry not, Takamine! I've never been on a luxury cruise ship, either! We're the same! It's so comforting to share something in common! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's extremely uncomforting for me…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Hah… The weather's nice, but the wind's cold… Maybe I'll stay in the ship…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mm? Ooh, Takamine! Your happiness will fly out if you sigh! You should just laugh off the cold! Fuhahaha!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh, an annoying person's here… Please don't start pestering me, Morisawa-senpai…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Sorry for being late, everyone!&quot;<br>💛&quot;Ahaha, you actually came earlier than the appointed time! …Huh? Midori-kun and Shinkai-dono are also with you.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I went to pick up Takamine, and as for Kanata, we met him on the way.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Uu~… I wanted to sleep until the last second…&quot;</p><h3 id="Gang">Gang</h3><p>(1, complete)</p><p>❤️&quot;I'll help you out with shopping for ingredients in exchange!

Then I say we don't join the festival…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Well done, Takamine! Glad to hear your opinion first! But I've already handed in the papers! We're going to do a food truck, no matter what!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;What do you guys want for the food? C'mon, c'mon~ Let me hear all your thoughts…♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ehhh… So you're just gonna ignore my thoughts…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're the one who was like, 'When it comes to festivals, you think food stalls!', then decided on everything on your own to drag us all into it… How about you think about how we feel…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Sorry! I'll make sure to do things only after I've talked to you guys, so forgive me!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I haven't cooked much, either! But it's okay! We can do it if we practice! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahhh, dammit! So you really didn't think this through…!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai, let's at least drop the food truck idea… It'll only be a disaster like this…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Don't give up, Takamine! We just need it to be food we can make, right? Right, right! Our options have gone down by a lot!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm fine with this. With cotton candy, we could ask for bags with our faces printed on them, and advertise our unit!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Don't… I'll tear every bag apart if you do that…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Don't glare at me like that, you're scaring me!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're dragging us into something annoying again… Who cares about that… Can't we just patrol normally…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You should care! There are all kinds of visitors coming—We can't let this perfect chance slide!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;We could wear a happi with our unit written on it, or carry around signboards… How about it? It'll attract attention for sure!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Please don't suggest stupid stuff… I'll lose all will to live if I'm seen like that…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Umm… I thought it was a good idea, though…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Then how about if Morisawa-senpai plays the victim role…? Though that has its own problems…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Now, now! We become stronger with every hardship! That's what being a hero's all about…! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;We're idols, not heroes… Wait no, being an idol is annoying too… Ughhh, everything about this is a big no… I just wanna die…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Are you alright, Takamine? You look exhausted. Go and take a rest on that chair!&quot;<br>💚&quot;M-Morisawa-senpai…? And Nagumo-kun came back, too… Y-You saved me… I almost lost all hope in this world and was ready to die…&quot;</p><h3 id="Orihime-and-Hikoboshi">Orihime and Hikoboshi</h3><p>(30, complete)</p><p>❤️&quot;What's up, Takamine, what's wrong!? Why are you slouching in the corner there!? Did something sad happen to you? Alright, don't worry, I'll share my energy with you! ☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ack—You're hot! It's not suffocating—it's literally like you're a burning hot pan…! Are you okay, Morisawa-senpai…? Do you have a fever or something…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Fuhaha! I see, I see! You too are a hero who loves peace! ☆ I feel the same way Takaminee~! We're the same! We're one in body and soul! Let's keep working hard together! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahh you're hot, you're insanely hot! Are you some heat power generator!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ah, no. It's just something I don't want Takamine to hear, so we'll talk about it in a cafe.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Wha…? What does that mean? Why am I being left out…?&quot;<br>✨&quot;Hey guys, look over here~! There's a bully in the club!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;D-Don't say it like that, Akehoshi, it makes me seem bad! I just want to talk about something only adults should know! It isn't for kids to hear!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm… Sounds even more suspicious now… But whatever… I don't really wanna be involved in any problems anyway…&quot;</p><p>🎸&quot;You're feeling lonely, right? Ahaha, you really do love Buchou~♪ You can't relax if he isn't hugging you every day, huh~?&quot;<br>💚&quot;……&quot;<br>🎸(…!? He ignored me!? I was trying to crack jokes with him to lighten the mood, but it failed~!)</p><p>💚&quot;Isara-senpai seems to be someone I can have an actual conversation with, unlike you and Morisawa-senpai…&quot;<br>✨&quot;Whaa? Don't put me together with Chi~chan-senpai! We can talk to each other, too! Let's get along! Handshake~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ughh… I knew it, this guy's also the pushy type…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai's always touchy-feely with us, so I bet he's got all kinds of germs on him…&quot;<br>💛&quot;Ah, no, he doesn't do that to me as much as he does to you, so I'm probably okay!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Why's he always so clingy with me… It's seriously a huge pain…&quot;<br>✨&quot;Ahaha, that's 'cause he always hugs the least energetic person he sees.&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;Hmm? Is Ryuseitai really always like that, Takamin?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh…? Yeah, basically… Morisawa-senpai would always show us what to do and guide us through practically everything… Like, it's as if he's just dragging us into whatever he's planned…&quot;</p><p>✨&quot;If you plan on learning from us, come back inside. We'd be in hot water too if you ended up collapsing. Chi~chan-senpai would get furious with me. I saw him angry like that once, and it was seriously terrifying.&quot;<br>💚&quot;……(stares curiously)&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;But then, they did another check up for me and confirmed I have no symptoms of the disease whatsoever, so don't worry! I've completely recovered! Sorry for leaving you all alone!&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, it would've been way more bothersome if you came over while you were feeling sick…&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Ahhh… Morisawa-senpai didn't listen to the doctor's advice and tried to come over, and so Shinkai-senpai did whatever he could to stop him. I see. Good work, Senpai~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;For real, good work… Gosh, Morisawa-senpai can be such a handful, huh…♪&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;We were told that we should do our best without relying on Taichou-dono, so I hid the fact that I was contacting him.&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's fine, really… Though I think I would've liked it if you told us he was doing okay… I couldn't really focus properly in practice from worry…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Hoho, is that so! I was a little nervous that you might not care about me, since you have absolutely zero manner points towards me, but you do love me as a comrade, huh! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Will you shut up… It's so suffocating… I wish you didn't come back until summer was over…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Actually, no—Let's do our best together, as we always do, Ryuseitai! All for one, one for all!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah, yeah… You really are feeling better… It's a relief to see you back to your usual self, alright?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai, you've been at maximum hyper for a while now… Not only will you drag us down if your health gets bad again, but you're also annoying when you're like that, so please don't go into overdrive…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You'll drag us down if your health gets bad again, plus, you're annoying when you're hyper, so please don't go into overdrive…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I feel like that 'annoying' bit was a bit too much! Or rather, saddening! But I'm aware! I'll never let myself get sick or collapse ever again!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori… Ughh, I'm already tired just from doing the stall…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Now now, no fussing!

Morisawa-senpai took him somewhere, 'cause he didn't want to talk about something where I could hear it… Sigh… I'm being left out of the group…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;I wonder what Morisawa-senpai wanted to talk about?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm~… If you're curious, how about going to the coffee shop? That's where they all said they'd talk… Even if he can't talk to me about it, I'm sure he'll talk to you about it, Anzu-san…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;I wonder what Morisawa-senpai wanted to talk about?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Who knows… He said it's between adults only, and that it isn't for kids to hear… I'm only one or two years apart from my seniors, so being treated as a kid is kinda just… Mm… It just doesn't feel good, y'know…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Sigh… I'm being left out of the group…&quot;<br>🎀&quot;That's not true.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Um, they all left to a coffee shop without me, though…? Well, whatever… Hanging out outside of club activities with my seniors, Morisawa-senpai included, would just be a pain…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ahh, Anzu-san… I'm really depressed right now, so it's best if you don't talk to me… Huh? Morisawa-senpai? What about him?&quot;<br>🎀&quot;It's lonely without him, isn't it?&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, I don't really feel lonely or anything, though…? If anything, it's nice how quiet it is without him…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;It's lonely without Morisawa-senpai, isn't it?&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, I don't really feel lonely or anything, though…? If anything, it's nice how quiet it is without him… But, well, since he's not around 'cause he's sick, I am a little worried… So I do want him to recover…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;I heard that they didn't find any serious illness.&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's way less noisy without him around though, so it's fine like this, isn't it… I heard from Isara-senpai that he went to the hospital… I wish he'd get that suffocating energy of his cured as well, while he's at it…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;I heard they didn't find any serious illness.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahh… Morisawa-senpai got a check-up at the hospital…<br>They didn't find anything, but he could still catch a cold with his current state, so he's being told to rest…? Ugh… I can't imagine that guy staying still and resting…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ughh… Did that guy really get sick…? He's as energetic as ever… He's been going around eating food from every stall, and playing that target shooting game… He even found a super sentai mask and got super excited over it… It's like he's a little kid…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;You seem happy.&quot;<br>💚&quot;I don't wanna be rude to a senior, but… Are you sure you don't have bad eyes, Anzu-san…?<br>I'm plummeting into depression right now… Sigh, I'm so depressed, I wanna die… But if I start sighing, Morisawa-senpai would probably tell me to cheer up…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;You seem happy.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahh… That's probably 'cause I got the plushie Morisawa-senpai won from the target shooting game… Heheh, its face is so odd, you can't even tell whether it's a bear or a dog… It's suuuper cute…♪<br>Morisawa-senpai does some nice things sometimes, huh…♪&quot;</p><h3 id="Buddy">Buddy</h3><p>(16, complete)</p><p>💛&quot;……&quot;<br>💚&quot;Sengoku-kun?

Nonetheless, I shall go and greet him~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ehhh… You don't have to do that… I don't wanna be near him as much as I can during summer… It's already suffocating and tiring as it is…&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;Taichou-dono is speaking to the shop clerk about hero figurines. He seems to be enjoying himself, so I might interrupt his conversation if I greet him…?&quot;<br>💚&quot;H-He's so embarrassing… I don't want anyone to think we know each other, so I'm leaving now before he notices me…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;No no, there's nothing like that here… The thought of Morisawa-senpai spotting me freaks me out, so I'd rather take the long way home than deal with that… That's all… C'mon, don't stand around… He may notice us if we're not quick enough… I really don't want that…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Hm?

I can feel hurt too, y'know! I'd rather you choose your wording more carefully!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;If I was asked to choose between all of my sentai figurines, I'd be at a loss!

The new drink they're selling comes with a limited mascot character bonus! How many should I buy…!?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hmm? You want more than one? Then I'll also buy a drink and give you the mascot as a bonus! ♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh, shoot… I messed up and grazed my arm… Oh well, it's only a light scratch, so it should heal in no time!&quot;<br>💚&quot;It may only be a 'scratch' for you, but it hurts just looking at it… I'll give you this mascot character band-aid as a special exception, so please use it…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;T-Takamine!? I was only trying to greet you with a hug—why did you bring out an eggplant!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Come any closer, and I'll shove this eggplant straight inside your pocket… I'm dead serious…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;What do you want, Morisawa-senpai…? If you've got nothing for me, I'm leaving…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Wait, wait, Takamine! You're already out the door before giving me a chance to tell you!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine, calling for me…!? This is worthy of a celebration! ♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;…Crap, I accidentally called Morisawa-senpai over… I wanna die…&quot;</p><p>🌻&quot;Midori-kun, you look down in the dumps today, don'tcha? I'm gonna tease ya if you keep this up~ pokepoke~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ughh, I'm feeling depressed 'cause Morisawa-senpai's gonna come over to pick me up as soon as class is over… You won't get a reaction out of me…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I thought I could have a peace of mind if I turned Morisawa-senpai into some sort of mascot, but every design ends up looking so overbearing…&quot;<br>✨&quot;Ahaha! That's just the norm for him! You're honestly better off not trying~&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Why do I have so many solo parts in this song when I don't even wanna stand out… I feel like Morisawa-senpai's got something against me…&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Uumyu, you've got some tricky parts… But I'm sure Taichou gave 'em to you 'cuz he knew you'd manage it just fine!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Gimme an energetic response, Midori-kun!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Um, aren't you becoming a little too similar to Morisawa-senpai lately, Tetora-kun?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ohhh!? I don't see Takamine at the club yet. Very well then, I'll go and pick him up…☆&quot;<br>✨&quot;I feel like it's partly your fault why he barely comes over… But eh, I doubt pointing that out would change anything.&quot;</p><p>🎸&quot;Buchou, be more careful with how you act, okay~? Subaru's one thing, but now Takamine's been complaining to me, too.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ohh, Takamine is comfortable complaining when it's you, huh!? That makes me feel a little lonely, but it's still great news! I'm counting on you, Isara!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Woah, it's rare for you to be the first one to practice, Shinkai-senpai! Where's the rest of us?&quot;<br>💙&quot;chiaki is picking up midori, and shinobu has a meeting with the broadcast committee. let's talk together for now~&quot;</p><h3 id="Greetings">Greetings</h3><p>(7, incomplete)</p><p>💚&quot;Why does Morisawa-senpai hug me every single chance he gets…? It's so annoying…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Morisawa-senpai's been picking up a basket of mushrooms, but they're all poisonous, so please throw them out later.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It's so hot… The sun's insanely suffocating…… It's starting to look like Morisawa-senpai now… This is so depressing…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It feels like it'd feel warm being nearby Morisawa-senpai, or at least, for some reason that's how it looks during winter…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;This morning, I picked Takamine up from his home, and all he could say was 'I'm so depressed' over and over again! Ha ha ha!! ☆ He's such a handful!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I collected some red mushrooms, but Takamine threw them all away because they're poisonous… Ghhh! Alas, it was not meant to be, Mushroom Red!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine looked at the sun and said, 'The burning bright red sun of life should just perish,' but I'll never perish!&quot;</p><h2 id="ES-ERA">ES!! ERA</h2><h3 id="Main-Story-2">Main Story !!</h3><p>(8, incomplete)</p><p>❤️&quot;What's up, Takamine! Does your stomach hurt!? Exercise is the perfect medicine for the stomach! Let's do hindu squats together! ☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Shut up. …Please look at this for a moment, Morisawa-senpai.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Did you just casually tell me to shut up!? With a low voice, too! Are you in your rebellious phase, Takamine~!? Is my love not reaching you!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;I was always acting 'rebellious' towards you, though…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Huh? Uhh… But is that okay for you? You're seeing me off for some reason, but don't you have loads of work to do for the rest of the day?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Yeah… You're right. You've grown so splendidly, Takamine. I'm so proud of you~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Do not pat my head.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;… Alright, I gotta hurry, so I'll be leaving now. I'll keep you updated.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Got it. Be careful, Takamine—I have a bad feeling about this.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;You were happy about possibly meeting Morisawa-senpai, since he's doing a drama shoot in the same place, weren't you?&quot;<br>💚&quot;I was not!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;We were just talking on HoldHands and that idiot was all giddy like, 'then I'll come see you, Takamine! ☆', and then had to go and find a way to come over and greet me!&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Ahh, so you did get to see him. Good, good, was he doing well?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Heh, let's see if you can get through my Takamine Barricade technique, a skill I learned from the now-deceased Morisawa-senpai.&quot;<br>💛&quot;No, no! You keep casually saying he's dead lately, but he'll be here as soon as he finishes his task, so please don't make our audience worry!&quot;</p><h3 id="Motor-Show">Motor Show</h3><p>(16, incomplete)</p><p>💚&quot;It's like I can barely get my point across with her… It really makes you think of a certain someone—&quot;<br>🖤&quot;…But if Morisawa-senpai was here, I bet he'd solve all our problems perfectly, no matter what they may be.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Uh, nobody mentioned that guy, though…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Besides, what's dead is dead; we have to overcome our hardships on our own now.&quot;<br>💛&quot;Hold on a moment! He isn't actually dead, y'know…!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;As a Ryuseitai member, he is… He's been doing way more work outside of the unit than I have…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Hmph… All his &quot;I love you&quot;'s weren't true after all; he's all talk and no action…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Are we really sure Morisawa-senpai and Shinkai-senpai are gonna stick around…? Or did they seriously lose all interest in being part of Ryuseitai…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;They have no idea how much Morisawa-senpai ran himself ragged with preparations and begging the higher-ups for permission, all for the sake of a festival that spanned only a moment in our lives.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;GOOOOOD WORK EVERYONE!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Eep!? What the—Hey, doesn't that stupidly loud voice sound way too familiar…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh!? You guuuys…!! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh, he just had to notice us.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Are you all feeling well? Sleeping well? Eating well? Keeping the flame of justice burning within your hearts well…!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Eugh…&quot;<br>💛&quot;'Eugh,' indeed… There's no way anyone could handle the embarrassment of someone loudly calling out to them from across the street…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You guuuys~! What're you talking about!? Yell back your responses so I can hear you! Let me in your conversations! Share with me your experiences!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Holy crap… It's been so long that I'd almost forgotten just how annoyingly loud he is… Why does he need to yell so much…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Can't I just head home first and let you guys deal with that mess of a guy…?&quot;<br>💛&quot;Ahaha, why do you want to head home? It's rare that we get to talk to him these days; you should join in, too!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…He's gone. What was that about…? He was acting kinda weird.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…Hey, you. Don't you dare think about slipping out of here all proud and happy—You're on stage right now, so please make sure to do what you're supposed to do.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;T-Takamine? What's wrong, you seem kind of angry…? You shouldn't kick your senior's butt, y'know?&quot;<br>💚&quot;So sorry about that. It was entirely an accident, my legs are just long.&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;fufu, it is because you are always late to the rescue, chiaki. midori and i start getting irritated the more we wait for you. after all, we knew for a fact that you would come over one way or another…&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;this performance requires all five of us for it to glow best, so you will not be helping anyone by stepping back, chiaki.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Exactly. Just having these M and N tags doesn't change a thing about us…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're still a hero, and a member of Ryuseitai at that, aren't you? So please don't go around showing your uncool side. It's gonna throw us off if you act so lame… Since you're still part of Ryuseitai, just like us.<br>~…♪&quot;</p><h3 id="Dollhouse">Dollhouse</h3><p>(36, complete)</p><p>💚(Ahh, man… I used to be able to ignore every bothersome thing without a second thought… But thanks to a certain someone, I now have something like a hero's voice inside me, constantly poking me to not be that way…)</p><p>💚(I feel like his overbearing blood is consuming my body, and it makes me wanna die… It'd be a different story if it's just learning from someone, but this is—… I really just don't wanna be infected by that guy of all people.)</p><p>💚(But I'm sure if Morisawa-senpai were here, he'd immediately help out without a second thought…)</p><p>💚(I think they'll be able to understand what's going on if I send a message saying, 'Kagehira-senpai is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse'… Now it's just deciding who to ask…<br>Ughh… A certain overbearing face keeps popping up… Go away.)</p><p>💚&quot;Ahh, dammit—Why does he come to mind when I'm in trouble… Is it 'cause he's a hero? (mumble, mumble)&quot;<br>🍬&quot;M-Midori-kun? Why're ya mumblin' ta yerself while typing…? Yer face's scarin' me…&quot;<br>💚&quot;Please don't mind me. I just felt a rush of irritation well up inside me…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;But I couldn't type the whole thing… Will he understand…? Actually, I wouldn't mind if he comes over 'cause of the message cutting off so strangely…&quot;</p><p>💚(Please, notice our SOS… I don't have that much hope in you, but I at least know you're a hero who'll come to the rescue, Morisawa-senpai…)</p><p>💚&quot;He's still not here…!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Mmm? I think this is that giant robot we had in front of the ES building for an event a while back… I think it's the chest piece?<br>Morisawa-senpai went nuts over it and sent me a whole bunch of photos, so I sorta remember it…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Oh yeah, hasn't enough time passed since I sent that message? I wish he'd notice the SOS and come rescue us already…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ughh… Weren't you supposed to be a hero to anyone in need…? You always stick your nose in my business even when I say no, so what gives…?<br>I know there's that whole 'a hero always arrives in the nick of time' saying, but can you not do that this time…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Mm… Where on earth is Takamine? It's already time for practice… I think his phone is dead because I can't call him, either.&quot;</p><p>❤️(I tried asking around, and it sounded like he was delivering vegetables early in the morning… The manager of Cinnamon said that he finished his delivery over there, so I don't think he's still delivering anything…)</p><p>❤️(I accidentally mentioned that I couldn't find Takamine anywhere and made the manager worried… I feel bad. I'll have to let them know when I find Takamine that everything's all right.)</p><p>❤️&quot;On the other hand, Takamine sure is hardworking! He's been properly going to school, doing his jobs, and even helping out his family's greengrocer!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;The manager also praised him a lot, and hearing it made me feel proud~♪<br>But if I said any of this to him, he might get angry at me again and tell me off for treating him like a kid… But I can't help it! I'm so happy to hear my junior getting praise and recognition!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh? What a coincidence! I'm also looking for Takamine!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine didn't pick up the phone when I called him because his phone died, but before that, he managed to send me this.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;In other words, Takamine is talking to Kagehira-kun about superhero staples, the shows that pop into your head when you think of heroes.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;They might be playing pretend in one right now, so Takamine wanted to message me saying he'll be late…!<br>But gosh, he's such a ditz—He sent me the message midway~☆&quot;</p><p>💚(Why won't you come save us…? Isn't a hero supposed to always come to the rescue whenever there's danger…?)</p><p>💚(I didn't believe that at first… But you'd always, always arrive on the scene—and you'd always, always, always, always be shouting as loud as you could…<br>And before I knew it, I started to think… maybe even believe, just a little, and yet—)</p><p>💚(It's not that I thought you'd never lie, but… I felt like… you wouldn't let it be a lie. I really started to feel that way.<br>That was enough for me to keep working as hard as I could…)</p><p>💚(So why…? Why won't you come…<br>… No. I'm already aware… I'm just taking it out on you.)</p><p>💚(I didn't wanna accept the truth, and it's been making my heart race like crazy…<br>'cause what's really making me mad… the one who's really pathetic right now is—)</p><p>💚&quot;All I ever do is whine, like I'm doing now… I even told Morisawa-senpai not to show an uncool side to us, like an arrogant idiot…<br>But in the end, I'm the one who's the really uncool, pathetic loser…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Are Takamine and Kagehira-kun really over here…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;So that means… What Takamine wanted to say was—'Kagehira-kun is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse'!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamineeeeee!!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Are you alright!? Are either of you hurt anywhere!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh? M-Morisawa-senpai…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;How'd you two unlock the door!? Did you have the key or something!?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? Key? There wasn't a lock or anything, though?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh? B-But, we couldn't open it no matter how hard we pushed or pulled…!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Umm…? It's a sliding door, y'know? Look—It opens when you slide it.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ha ha ha!! ☆ Don't be that way, Takamine! You two are safe, and that's all that matters!<br>Don't worry about it! We all have days when we fail—that's what makes us human! Failures are the key to success!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Shut up. Don't you dare say 'failure' again.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;If you're a boy, then leap forth with full confidence! Jump out and reach for your future, Takamine! ☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine! Our comrades are waiting for your return! Let's return at the speed of a shooting star!&quot;<br>💚&quot;……&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? No response!? What's wrong, what's up!?&quot;</p><p>💚(He's the same old overbearing Morisawa-senpai, right…?<br>My eyes must've tricked me for a moment. It was pretty dark in there… and out of nowhere, it suddenly got really bright… I'm sure that's the real reason why Morisawa-senpai and Aoba-senpai looked like heroes…)</p><p>💚&quot;—He'll only get more overbearing if I say that out loud, so I'll keep it to myself.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Did you say something, Takamine?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Nope. Yeah, you're right. That's enough darkness for one day. Let's go somewhere brighter.&quot;</p><h3 id="Flowers-of-the-Wasteland">Flowers of the Wasteland</h3><p>(4, incomplete)</p><p>by Anonymous and bot owner</p><p>💚&quot;You really didn't have to follow Morisawa-senpai's footsteps when it comes to that…&quot;<br>🎸&quot;Wha~? I'm gonna tell him to come over if you keep saying stuff like that, y'know~?&quot;</p><p>By bot owner</p><p>💚&quot;Eep—No, that's the worst idea ever…! That guy's graduated already, but he still torments me… I had a nightmare about him just the other day, y'know…!?<br>I even sweated through my blanket in my sleep… I really don't want him to show up anywhere outside of work…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ehhhh… But now I feel like I'm being left out, and I don't like that…<br>And Morisawa-senpai's always been pretty secretive about the stuff that's actually important… Is it 'cause I'm not trustworthy…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ughhh… You're so overbearing, it's reminding me of Morisawa-senpai…&quot;</p><h3 id="Bogie-Time">Bogie Time</h3><p>(1, complete)</p><p>From ENGstars translations</p><p>🌹&quot;Hmm… Would Morisawa-shi still be happy if I flicked a supplement pill towards him as a packed lunch?&quot;<br>☕&quot;Yes. I think he'll still be happy and say something like, 'Thank you! I was just in the mood for this!'—In fact, I heard him say this exact sentence to Takamine-kun once.&quot;</p><h3 id="Comet-Show">Comet Show</h3><p>(105, incomplete)</p><p>From ENGstars translations</p><p>💚&quot;That means he's not actually asking for our opinions… Morisawa-senpai is always like this…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You two over there! Stop complaining! Use that time to face your troubles! Change all of your powah into energy! Transform!&quot;<br>💚&quot;How energetic can you get…? So annoying…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ah, that's right~ You do get weirdly excited after an all-nighter… Guess Morisawa-senpai didn't get much sleep… See, his eyes look a bit red, too…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm too sca—I mean, I don't have much interest in movies that only feature kaijuus! So I don't really know anything about them!&quot;<br>💚&quot;And you still had the confidence to say that you'd show us an example…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ahh… Morisawa-senpai's appearance in that new tokusatsu show has been officially announced, so he probably started training already…&quot;<br>💛&quot;As always, you are extremely knowledgeable about Morisawa-dono, Midori-kun.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Yeah, how come you know everything about him? Do you regularly search for 'Morisawa Chiaki' online or something?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah, I do. What's wrong with that…? I don't actually care if he's dead or alive, but I need to monitor him to see if he says anything bad about me, y'know…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It's saying something if Shinobu-kun of all people felt angry. Is that guy an evil god that came down to destroy humanity or something…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Yeah… They gallantly appeared before us when we were about to give up. I thought they were gonna say, 'Never give up!' or something equally hot-blooded—But they suddenly started to spill out nonsense… Saying things that were completely unreasonable and ridiculous…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Before that guy's graduation, he'd always pester me no matter how many times I refused him, but now I can't see him unless I go out of my way to find him…? That's so unreasonable…&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;heyy~! you guuuuys~! ehehe, i am pretending to be chiaki~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Please don't do that… If you also start to act like him, then it's going to be utter hell… It's already bad enough that Tetora-kun is acting more and more like that guy lately…&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;Ah, is he the one who's wearing a full-body suit over there? Morisawa-dono is performing as the kaijuu role in this new show, right?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ah, yeah, it does look like his movement.&quot;<br>🖤&quot;In what way?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I don't really wanna complain about this, but thanks to you two seniors, I feel like this mental cold will drag on for a bit longer…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Hey… Morning, I guess~…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Wow, you sound like a convenience store worker who has no motivation whatsoever!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Sigh… Good morning… Both of you are always so energetic…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Takamine~! You're late! I got so worried! I thought you got in an accident!&quot;<br>💚&quot;I'm not late, though… You two are too early. Why are you so enthusiastic, anyway…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;(mumble) I thought this was the last day the five of us could be together, so I've been depressed about it…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;What's wrong!? You look down! Are you alright!? Did something bad happen!? Alrighty, I'll share a part of my po~wer with you! There, there, good boy, good boy~☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Alrighty then, I'll share a part of my po~wer with you! There, there, goood boy, good boy~☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;You're being annoying, so can you stop hugging me…? Also, I wanted to ask this for a long time—why do you say 'power' in a weird way…?&quot;<br>💙&quot;fufu, you're so close to each other~&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;What's wrong!? You're so gloomy! But it makes me feel nostalgic to see you so gloomy! Alright, let me share my passion, my light, and my po~wer with you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;I'm gonna kill you if you say that 'po~wer' one more time.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Why!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Because it's getting on my nerves…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Did you forget? I'm not a morning person, so I'm always this depressed… It's not like I'm upset or anything. This is how I usually am…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;That's right. Are you okay lately? Are you able to wake up properly without my help? Mom's worried about you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;You're not my mama.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I've already had enough of these two ridiculous seniors—Tetora-kun, Shinobu-kun, come here already~…!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Look, Takamine! Look! Sunfish! They're cute and just like you, don't you think? I mean, you can't tell if they're dead or alive…!&quot;<br>💚&quot;I'm actually in awe if you really think that's a compliment.&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;sunfish are high-maintenance, so we weren't sure if we should have them here.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Right, and in that regard, I'm also like those sunfish—is that what you wanna say, Morisawa-senpai?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;D-Don't treat everything as a bad comment about yourself! That's a bad habit, Takamine!&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;'tricky' and 'troublesome' are sometimes forms of compliments, too~♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Kanata! Nice follow-up! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;That doesn't cancel out what you said… Can you pay more attention to what you're saying? Though I'm also at fault for thinking everything at its worst—&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;—It's unfortunate, though.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Fwuh? W-What do you mean…? I mean, it's true our achievements are pretty unfortunate compared to yours…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;What're you on about? I've said this many times—you're all doing incredible! You're already way better than us as idols at your age!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Frankly, I did want to do something more like an idol back then. But that wish came true when you all joined us the next year, Takamine. So again, thank you for making my dream come true! Thank you all…☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…Apart from that, why did you say 'unfortunate' earlier? What was 'unfortunate'?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mm, I just feel that it's unfortunate that Nagumo and Sengoku are going to be late. I was planning to talk about something serious with the five of us all together.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Wait, why didn't you ask? It's important to report, contact, and communicate!&quot;<br>💚&quot;How can you say that when you keep carrying all the burden on yourself without telling anyone…?&quot;</p><p>💚(Because of that, I ended up with Morisawa-senpai alone… Like we're on a meaningless date in this aquarium… It's almost like I'm bonded with Morisawa-senpai by fate, and I hate it… It also just feels so lonely with everyone apart from each other…)</p><p>By bot owner</p><p>❤️&quot;Look, Takamine! They're selling plushies of some deep-sea creatures! I have no idea what they're meant to be!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You love these kinds of loose-looking and shapeless creatures, right!? Alrighty then, your dad will buy it for you to commemorate us spending time together in the aquarium today!&quot;<br>💚&quot;You're not my papa either, 'kay?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're not my papa either, 'kay?<br>(Actually, right now it does kinda feel like he's a dad awkwardly trying to appease his daugh—his son in order to improve their strained relationship… But it's such a fitting scenario that I don't wanna say it out loud…)&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh, look over here! This one looks exactly like you! So cute~!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Do you seriously not have any other way to compliment people…? And for the record, being compared to some mysterious deep-sea creature doesn't make me happy at all, 'kay…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh, was that a pun!? Good one, Takamine! You win first prize…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh, shut up… Man, it's been a while since we've had a back-and-forth like this.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ah, I was thinking something similar just now. It's always so nice to share something in common, no matter what it is, huh? That feeling of joy gets cut in half whenever it's with you, though.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Why did you have to add that!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Then who would you have instead preferred to be with right now? Nagumo? Sengoku? Or maybe Kanata? Why’re you always so blunt towards just me!? Your dear ol’ grandpa feels so lonely!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Could you at least stick to one role…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Your dear ol' grandpa feels so lonely!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Could you at least stick to one role…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Alright… But, as pathetic as this may sound, I don't even know what we are to you guys right now anymore.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I can't seem to manage it at all. It's hard to be a kaijuu.&quot;<br>💚&quot;From what I saw when I was at the studio the other day, I think you managed to perform your kaijuu role pretty well. Well, not that I know enough about them to be sure of that…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh, I appreciate you telling me that! You're really good at giving compliments! You're always so harsh, so a compliment from you makes me extra happy, like I really did do a good job!&quot;<br>💚&quot;What're you talking about…? Even I give honest compliments sometimes too, y'know…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Hehe, I do have a few things I want to improve on, though. Starting with what my director pointed out: I had an overwhelming presence for a kaijuu.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahhh~… Yeah, I always think that about you, too…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yeah, I'm sorry for being so overbearing.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Hm? What's wrong? It's rare to see you make such a grim face; did a monster invade the streets or something?&quot;<br>💚&quot;You watch way too much tokusatsu, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>❤️(Mmm~… I have nothing to do while Takamine talks on the phone. Maybe I should check my work contacts on HoldHands while I have the time.)</p><p>❤️&quot;(But… That's exactly why this time around—For the sake of the kids who turned me, a cowardly crybaby, into a hero—)<br>Takamine.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ah, yes. I'm sorry, the call is over now. …What's with the serious face?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I'm always serious! And I seriously love you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Die, please. …I'm well aware how badly you wanna look cool—you're just a liar as fake as paper-mache.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Die, please. …I'm well aware how badly you wanna look cool—you're just a liar as fake as paper-mache.<br>You don't have to hide your true form from the people close to you, the same heroes as you—do you?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;We're not in some old tokusatsu show or American comic, so why do you keep hiding your true self?<br>What, is your family gonna be held hostage by an evil organization if people find out your true identity? Or are you gonna get arrested for being a vigilante or something?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I doubt you've done anything illegal in the first place, and we've grown strong enough to protect ourselves by now.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Could you quit pretending not to see us for ourselves already? It pisses me off…<br>You keep treating us like weaklings who need to be protected, just so you can remain as the hero.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;T-That isn't what I—<br>I just don't want my place of belonging—the dream I've finally achieved—to be smashed into pieces again.&quot;<br>💚&quot;'Again'? I dunno what you're on about, but you really are looking down on us, aren't you…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;But Senpai, did you know? As the leader of Ryuseitai-N, Tetora-kun did an amazing job protecting and raising ten times the amount of pathetic juniors than you have.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Well, I think Tetora-kun will keep pushing forward no matter what, and work as hard as he can. So don't just give up like that; please keep supporting him in every way you can—Senpai.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm aware. Our decision to leave Ryuseitai has to do with that, too. There are some things that are hard to do while wearing the mask of justice.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh, is that so… And here I thought you were working yourself to the bone 'cause you wanted that 'mask' so badly.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;………&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm the worst out of the flock, so I guess that's why you kept supporting me the most, like during Repayment Festival—But Shinobu-kun and Tetora-kun both probably went through a similar life to mine; I'm sure they barely got any praise from anyone in the past.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh, really…? But I was trying my best to hug, pat and praise them for every single thing they do.&quot;<br>💚&quot;You're awful at it… Like, you do that to basically everyone in the same fashion, so it's hard to tell if that's real praise or not.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;It always felt like you were just trying to praise us with something, anything, like giving candy to a kid, and it really ticked me off.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I see… This is quite difficult for me. I'm not that good at communicating with people, to be honest. I was living a very lonely youth before I met you guys.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;So that hot-blooded heroic stuff you do really was an act all along… Well, I figured it was…<br>It felt so fake to see you act that way. Like, I'd keep thinking there's no way a person like this actually exists in real life. You always acted as if a camera was recording you.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing… But in that sense, it's incredible how you can act so naturally all the time.&quot;<br>💚&quot;You say that like it's a good thing… I just find acting a pain to do… There was nothing I wanted so badly that I'd go through the effort of doing that.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;But things are different now. I have something I want—something I wanna get no matter what it takes.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? What would that be? Could it be my love or something!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;You'd push that on me even if I said I didn't want it, wouldn't you?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Huh, I see. I think it's cute, though.&quot;<br>💚&quot;I think so, too. We agree for once, huh, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;As always, you're so bad at figuring things out. Lemme put it in other words—<br>It's kinda messy, but… To put it simply, it's our turn to shine, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It all makes sense now! I feel a weight off my back with that mystery solved.&quot;<br>💚&quot;What is there to even feel relieved over…? Seriously, what the hell is 'final parting memory' even supposed to mean…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I don't think the kaijuu role suits you, though. —You're much more suited to be this, aren't you?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hmm, so… the outfits Anzu handed to us earlier were for the live show?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Wow, she managed to stitch them up in such a short amount of time. I feel like she's becoming superhuman at this point.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Everyone's been getting better and stronger, you've just been pretending not to see it.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh! How convenient! The toilet's right in front of us!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Okay, feel free to change first.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? We aren't changing together? We'd get the job done faster that way, though! C'mon, all the kiddos are waiting for our rescue!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;For some reason, I can't stomach the idea of being in a tight space with you…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You can't stomach the idea!? Why do you say that, Takamine!? I'm not planning on doing anything strange! I promise!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Why do I get the feeling you'll break your promise in an instant…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Let's not complicate this and just change after each other, 'kay? We'll be failures as heroes if we don't make it on time for an important moment.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;True… But am I really going as Red again? I've been telling all of you over and over again that Nagumo's the current leader of Ryuseitai…&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mmm~… I think it's only you tokusatsu fans who waste your time caring about that kind of thing…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Every last one of you are so insistent on making everything harder on yourselves with this pointless stuff—It's all so dumb.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;……?&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;You arrived so late! We were so worried for you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah, sorry about that… I had an argument with Morisawa-senpai on the way here…&quot;<br>💛&quot;A-Again…?&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Yup, yup. But that said, where is Morisawa-senpai anyway…? Shouldn't he have been with you, Midori-kun?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm… There wasn't enough time to pre-record the kaijuu's part of the script, so he's improvising it live with that stupid voice you're hearing instead…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;He looked happy when he was talking about how grateful he was for the opportunity to practice his kaijuu performance, but… I bet he'd much rather be a hero…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I bet he'd much rather be a hero… And let's be real, a kaijuu role of all casting choices is the last thing his fans would consider suitable for him, sooo… We need to get him out of that role already.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Of all people who'd nitpick, I didn't expect it to be you, Shinkai-senpai… Morisawa-senpai had to rush a script out on his way here, so you'll just have to accept the bad writing for what it is…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;The Great Kaijuu's carrying the entirety of mankind's malice inside of it—and while Morisawa-senpai may put up a strong front and all, he's too weak and dumb to win against something that massive all on his own.<br>As much as it pains me, I guess we'll just have to back him up.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Red! You're gonna get fried if you just stand there all alone! Get your ass over here! Do we have to tell you what to do every time!?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;W-Why're you snapping at me, Green!? And watch your language! You should speak to your seniors politely! Promise me that, okay!?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Exactly. We're only two years apart, but you still act like you're sooo much more mature than us—&quot;<br>❤️&quot;W-Why are you guys being so harsh!? You keep firing off one remark after the other! But it's fine, I guess! It reminded me of our time during Supernova!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;In fact! Tokusatsu has incredible technology to make even the fakest things look super realistic!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh, that description sounds exactly like you… Ahhh, so that's why you love tokusatsu so much…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;H-How did you even reach that conclusion!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm not made of paper-mache! And even if I was, I can assure you that I've been doing my absolute best to improve and polish myself, inside and out!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Well, yeah, that's why you're ES's pride, and such an in-demand entertainer right now.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…Why…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Why are you, a stupidly positive person… holding back and giving up so easily on the unit that should mean so much to you?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You're going to bring that up again, Takamine?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Well, the truth is… Another reason we were late was because Takamine threw a tantrum.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Now you're calling it a tantrum… Fine, so it kinda was one, but you're just spreading misinfo and making me look bad…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mm, I'm sorry. I swear I'm not angry at you or anything.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Fine, sure, I did throw a tantrum. But when I couldn't move a single muscle anymore, that idiot over there gently stretched out his hand to me.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;He started telling me, 'you don't have to force yourself,' 'you don't have to do it if you don't want to,' 'you could even run away if you like.'<br>'You don't have to hold yourself back, and if anybody makes a fuss, I'll protect you from it.'&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;That stupid hero over there started to say stupidly heroic stuff to me.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;…What else should I have done?&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, you can stay that way. You're just acting as the ideal hero you dreamed to be—Or well, maybe saying that is off. That's just you properly being a hero, right?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm supposed to be capable of proudly saying I'm a hero, and yet, I wasn't able to fulfill my duty as one. Even when there was someone right in front of me acting as a role model, showing me how to do it in the simplest visual possible.&quot;</p><p>🖤(Wait, no… He does actually say rude stuff to some people, like Morisawa-senpai. What's that all about anyway? Is he trying to act like a spoiled kid around him—or maybe they're messing around with each other? I mean, it sounds like it's how he expresses his love, so…?)</p><p>💚&quot;That's the kind of sneaky strategy I'm going for here… He he he~♪&quot;<br>💙&quot;hmm, i see. but you do not have to copy after chiaki when it comes to that.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Huh!? Was I ever the type to do that sort of sneaky stuff!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah, I learned this trick from you, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Huh!? Was I ever the type to do that sort of sneaky stuff!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah, I learned this trick from you, Senpai. I've grown up enough to understand what you've actually been doing for us all along.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm sorry for doing it without your approval first, but you're all used to that 'cause of Morisawa-senpai anyway…<br>I mean, the guy used to constantly make us do hero shows out of nowhere, right?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;…That's true.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You've perfectly re-enacted my way of doing things, huh? You must've observed my lifestyle very carefully, and did your best to understand me.<br>That is, without a doubt, love. Thank you, I love you too.&quot;<br>💚&quot;I'm gonna kick you off the stage.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You guys have such a weird fixation on pointless stuff like who gets to wear the red uniform, but… I think we should all wear what we wanna wear, including our favorite color.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I hate how a convention that nobody even knows the origins of is souring Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun's relationship… That weird tradition can go eat shit.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;'Tradition can go eat shit,' huh…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;On our way here, Takamine and I had a similar conversation.<br>It was a little awkward because he kept throwing a tantrum, but one of the wonderful things about him is that he doesn't put up a strong front like I do.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;He's honest with himself, and so genuinely dazzling. He spoke out the feelings I was trying my best to hide deep inside me—the same feelings you guys likely had, too.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;While we were on the verge of losing hope from the crushing reality, Takamine found our true feelings for us. Then he did his best to extend his hand as far as he physically could to try and save our hearts—as a hero.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;In reality, as Takamine said, we could just wear outfits of the color we like—a color that suits who we are. And there's nobody else in this world who's wanted to wear the red color more than I have, ever since childhood.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;We'll start over and assemble everything all over again. What we want to protect isn't a tradition—it's our freedom, our happiness, and the smiles of ourselves and our fans.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mhm, mhm, exactly… That's what you should've done from the very beginning.&quot;</p><h4 id="Mini-talks">Mini talks</h4><p>💚(Let's search for… 'Morisawa, Chiaki'…<br>Huh, there really are a lot of people talking about his casting role in the new tokusatsu show… Where the heck did they get this info from, anyway…?)</p><p>💚&quot;I was searching topics about Morisawa-senpai on social media… I'd hate to find out that he's been talking behind our backs, so I regularly search his name as a check-up.<br>…Why're you asking me if I'm okay…? Isn't it normal to look up stuff about your senior online…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Oh, you should blame Morisawa-senpai for that. I was just searching up his name on social media… I tend to search his name every once in a while, but I've been doing it way more often lately 'cause I'm frustrated that he's barely concerned about us nowadays…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Thanks to searching up his name, I have all his talk shows memorized in my head… Ugh, this sucks, I'm not even a fan of him or anything…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…Ah, please check this out. This soft drink ad just showed up on my social media. It's showing Morisawa-senpai in full… He's gotten a lot of comments from his fans, too.<br>Let's see… 'I'm wishing you the best, Chiaki-kun,' 'I love you, Chiaki-kun'… Man, he sure is popular…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ohh, you're the one who suggested this to him? I mean, I guess it does suit his image and all, but… since I know what he's actually like, I can't help but feel like everyone's being tricked…<br>We're talking about a guy who literally yells &quot;Okaa-saaan!!&quot; to the ocean, y'know…?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Huh, the ad does kinda suit his image. I guess he does look like a pleasant person when he smiles—as long as he keeps his mouth shut, that is.<br>If only he always looked this calm in real life, and maybe then I'd finally be able to live my life peacefully…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;No, it's just, he feels so far away… He was always pestering me every day last year… So why's it so hard just to meet up with him now…? It makes no sense to me…<br>I should give him an earful or two the next time we meet, don't you think? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I know there's no point in me getting angry at an ad, but I'm kinda upset, like… 'What the hell are you smiling over when your unit's suffering right now'…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;He's supposed to be the number one person who wants to be a hero, but instead he asks to leave the unit? Does he ever bother to think about how we feel?<br>If you're such a hero of justice and all, then how about you consider protecting your own comrades' feelings, huh…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Our seniors are always so random with their decisions. I wish they'd understand that you need to explain yourself first before deciding on something.&quot;</p><h3 id="Submarine">Submarine</h3><p>(10, incomplete)</p><p>💚&quot;That guy gets lonely easily, after all… He'd much rather spend time being close with everyone as much as he can, so if he's been working on his own, then, yeah… I guess that really is his order.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're not spilling private info about me to them, are you…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Fear not, Takamine! I doubt that Akatsuki has any interest in you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Hah? I mean I guess that's true, but did you have to put it that way…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Oh? Don't you worry, Takamine! I'm extremely interested in you!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;My order was super simple; I just had to avoid touching that thing I love during the round… and I'm not an infant or something… I can put up with it just fine…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;That thing you love? Oh, I get it now! So that's why you kept your distance from me all this time, Takamine!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;We're pretty sensitive people… The only ones who're broad-minded enough to get through anything are Shinobu-kun and Shinkai-senpai… the ratio is two to three…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Oh, you included me in the 'sensitive' category, too!? I'm so glad to know that you understand me, Takamine!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Hmph… You do realize we've known each other long enough that none of us would still think you're a hot-headed, dumbass hero without a single thought in his head, right… We've all seen you read books with glasses on before you sleep…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;What do glasses have to do with it!?&quot;</p><h4 id="Mini-talks-2">Mini talks</h4><p>❤️&quot;Heheh, there are Okinawan souvenirs here! Oh, they have a handful of mascots; which do you think would suit Takamine, Sengoku? Since you're the same age as him, I'd be happy to get your advice on which to get him!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;They have a handful of mascots here; which do you think would suit Takamine, Sengoku?&quot;<br>💛&quot;The bitter melon mascot would suit him perfectly!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You're right, Takamine would love a mascot souvenir based on a vegetable!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It's lunch time now! Takamine, make sure that you eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;Sigh…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm? Why're you sighing? Are you low on nutrients due to a lack of meat!? Eating well will help regulate your mood! Don't be picky with your food, okay?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It's lunch time now! Takamine, make sure that you eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;I know.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mhm, that's good then! I guess I meddled a little too much. We're in Okinawa, y'know? I'd love to see you try a few of their cuisine~♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It's lunch time now! Takamine, make sure that you eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;I ate already.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Oh, that's good! I had the wrong idea because of the vegetables on your plate. Wonderful, Takamine, you ate so much! I'll eat just as much to grow big! ☆&quot;</p><h3 id="Whispering-Marina">Whispering Marina</h3><p>(1, complete)</p><p>💚&quot;Tokusatsu shows aren't just for kids.

The more ideas, the better, right…? Plus, heroes are supposedly the type to come rushing to the rescue for anyone in need.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ah, wait, that reminds me! The message was one thing, but you really didn't need to attach a photo of an entire box of eggplants after it!<br>Why did you go with an eggplant baron!? Weren't there plenty of other options among all the vegetables!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Why an eggplant baron!? Weren't there other vegetables you could choose!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh? Didn't you always say that the stronger the enemy, the better? So I chose something powerful enough for you to struggle with.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Gghh!? That's not how I expected my words to be interpreted…!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Didn't you always say that the stronger the enemy, the better? So I chose something powerful enough for you to struggle with.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ggh!? I didn't expect it to be interpreted that way…! Though I did struggle to hold in blocking you on sight, even when I knew it was from you…!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I did struggle to hold back blocking you on sight, even when I knew it was from you…!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Excuse me!? You've got some nerve to complain about our high quality eggplants… How about I send you a box for yourself, huh?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I-I don't want it! I really, really don't!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;There's no need to hold back…♪ I'm indebted to you time and time again, so it'll be like a summer gift.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I-I'm not holding back anything, though…? While I'm grateful to receive gratitude from my junior, I quite honestly would rather you refrain from sending me a box!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Huh!? W-What do you mean by all of that…!? Didn't we talk passionately about tokusatsu shows in our school year together!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;That's 'cause you always mention it to us after every Sunday… so we just so happened to follow along…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Hmm… Takamine's likely rooted in front of the souvenir shop in the village. Remember when we struggled to get him out of there after we were done with Scroll of the Elements?&quot;</p><h4 id="Mini-talks-3">Mini talks</h4><p>🖤&quot;Midori-kun sent a fishy message to Morisawa-senpai that said 'eggy-eggplant', but he managed to understand it just fine, and I don't get how…&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;Huh? You helped Midori-kun out with packing up eggplants in a box? Ahaha, he seriously sent Morisawa-senpai eggplants? I thought that was a joke…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;I wonder if he accepted those eggplants?&quot;<br>🖤&quot;I dunno… I haven't heard anything 'bout it. Oh, wait, I do kinda remember hearing a scream yesterday… It vaguely sounded like Morisawa-senpai's voice…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ermm, let's see, we have our meeting at the half hour mark, which is ten minutes from now. Morisawa-senpai always says stuff like, 'It's only natural to be ten minutes early to a job as a working adult!', so I think you're right on time.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm gonna pack up this box of eggplants and send it to Morisawa-senpai. I sent him an urgent message the other day, but he arrived late to our meeting anyway, so this is gonna be his punishment.&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;Would this really count as a punishment?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Well, it'd definitely work as one for Morisawa-senpai. But I heard heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary, so maybe he'll actually cry tears of joy for the opportunity.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm gonna place this eggplant box in front of Morisawa-senpai's room. I'm excited to see how he'll react…♪&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;Will this make him happy?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Hmmm… I wrote 'Eggplants' really big on the box, so… He'll likely jump the moment he sees the box, for starters. He may not even try opening it… But, well, I'll see what I'll do when that happens.&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;You're very close.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh? You think I have a close relationship with Morisawa-senpai…? No, no, that's not true… I don't know why you'd think we're on intimate terms…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;T-The truth is… there was a box in front of my dorm room yesterday… On it said 'to Morisawa-senpai', and… the name of that…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Y-Yeah… Exactly, I received eggplants… I can only think of one person who'd do this, but I didn't expect him to actually send me a box…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary! I'll make sure to overcome this obstacle, no matter what it takes!&quot;<br>🎀&quot;Somebody said the exact same thing…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ohh, that's cool! They must be a tokusatsu fan! Who was it?

You little rascal~ You're late! ♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I know I'm insistent by always saying this, but you need to be diligent about checking business-related messages!

How about you take a seat next to me for now? ♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It's good to be busy, but are you okay? You'll hurt yourself if you keep on working nonstop… Are you sure you aren't overdoing it?&quot;<br>💚&quot;No… I think I'm closer to breaking down emotionally rather than physically, so I've been keeping myself busy to get my mind off things…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Don't misunderstand, Takamine. You did nothing wrong. So you don't need to fret yourself over any of this.&quot;<br>💚&quot;There you go again; it's 'cause you never let us bear any of that burden that—&quot;<br>💛&quot;—Mm, mm!!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ah, sorry, it got tense again… It's really painful to see, right…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine is still prioritizing his personal work as we speak, but… I suppose he can't boycott the work he had already agreed to do, so it can't be helped.<br>He used to have no motivation, but now works hard on his jobs no matter the reason.

Goood mooorning! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Oh… I'm in a dream, huh…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Now, now, you shouldn't escape reality so quickly, Takamine! Open your eyes! Look around you! The reality known as us has arrived! Fuhahaha! ☆&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;What do you want so early in the morning…? Not only Morisawa-senpai, but even Shinkai-senpai… Unlike that guy over there, you aren't the kind of insane person who would attack someone in their sleep, right?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm begging you, please don't terrorize my peaceful daily life… Are you two a natural disaster or kaijuu or something?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Why, of course we aren't kaijuu! We're heroes of justice! We're trying our hardest to be that!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I can't even reach a signal, no matter how many times I phone him.&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's not 'cause you were so annoying that he blocked you… right?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Nope! I think it's only you who'd do something as cruel as that to me, Takamine!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It's a burden to always ask for a mediator like Kanata to relay my messages whenever I want to contact you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's an honor to know that I was able to become special to you, Senpai.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mhm! I'd love it if we could become special in a more positive way! You little~! ♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm sure even you understand that we can't just stand around and do nothing, right, Takamine?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Well, yeah, obviously… But what're we even planning to do? You can't get contact with either of them, right?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You're not gonna suggest going there to find out, are you…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep, that's exactly what we'll do! Worry not, Takamine! I've already told our agency! We can leave our work aside and focus on this matter!&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's only when it's least necessary that he's super fast to work…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;In fact, this is what I should've done yesterday! I regret not taking action earlier…! Due to my careless decisions, even Sengoku has fallen prey to them!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Erm, he's not dead or anything though, right? Isn't he smiling and doing a peace sign in the photo…?&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;So I wouldn't be wrong to assume that this means that Crimson Production is on the side of justice, would I?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Guhhh… This is so frustrating. There's nothing I can even say to counter that…&quot;<br>💚&quot;Just seeing Morisawa-senpai this frustrated brings me joy somehow.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Just seeing Morisawa-senpai this frustrated brings me joy somehow.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;W-Why, Takamine!?

I don't recall ever raising you to be such a mean-spirited boy, who would laugh at other people's demise!&quot;<br>💚&quot;I don't recall being raised by you, either.&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;fufu, thanks to midori's realistic response, we did not raise suspicions among the staff members.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Well, that's just an afterthought. To be honest, I didn't think Takamine would participate in this mission at all.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I thought Takamine would be too terrified to participate in our plan, and would ask to stay back at a hotel. Were that the case, I was planning to have him return to ES alone and be a messenger to report various matters to Tenshouin.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Why would you think that…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;The moment I touched your hand, Nagumo, I knew for sure that you didn't betray us — that you didn't become tainted with evil. I was certain that you were still one of us.&quot;<br>💚&quot;That's just plain incredible… I genuinely thought Tetora-kun did a complete 180…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;He's too good at acting, that not even society realizes Morisawa-senpai's just an imposter acting as a hero. So they misunderstand and unreasonably raise the bar for him, that if he shows his true self now, they'll accuse him of being a liar and a fraud… It's pretty sad.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;So they misunderstand and unreasonably raise the bar for him, that if he shows his true self now, they'll accuse him of being a liar and a fraud… It's pretty sad.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You understand me far too well, Takamine. It just goes to show how much you love me.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Just die.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;I don't think you guys need to force yourselves to get involved with this. Tomorrow, I'll turn a blind eye to let you guys escape. I want you to get some rest today in preparation for that.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Now you're also being distant… You've really inherited all the wrong things…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Everyone will do their best in their respective roles, and will definitely be able to produce a wonderful piece of art.&quot;<br>💚&quot;What are you even on about? You suddenly become so enthusiastic whenever it's about tokusatsu…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;No, I'm talking about real life.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;I didn't know a tunnel existed… Maybe we could use it as an escape route as a last resort.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Nah, I doubt this'd connect all the way to the outside… They wouldn't choose this place for our confinement otherwise.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;That'd be a little too careless on their side, yeah.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;They may catch on if we keep repeating this, but it should still be okay for now. Midori-kun's known as the unmotivated character.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yeah. In fact, it's surprising that even Takamine stayed in this dangerous place. He could've run back to ES as soon as he had the chance…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine's been a man with an element of surprise this time around.&quot;<br>💚&quot;If you're actually surprised, then that just means you never once understood me. Besides, we all decided that we'd stay here together. I don't wanna be the only one who's left out.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;We all decided that we'd stay here together.

Sorry about that.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;We just went from 'Ryuseitai' to 'Ryuseitai Black'… I don't feel like much has changed.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I like it, it reminds me of Kamen Rider!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;With the usual Ryuseitai, I don't really get to play as a villain 'cause Morisawa-senpai doesn't like those roles much, so this feels new… Ahh~ It's sooo much easier to play the villain~ You don't have to worry about all kinds of things~…♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I don't have to preach about justice or morality or whatever else I don't even believe in.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Y-You disliked playing the hero of justice that much!? You could've told me so!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Did it look like I could ever mention that?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Life is so easy when someone else does all the work to solve the problem without you ever lifting a finger.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You weren't having an easy time either, though. You're so worn out that you have circles under your eyes, Takamine. You did your best, too. We all did our best.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Starting with the guy who's trying to look like he has nothing to do with this — Takamine! You're very much involved in this, too!

I watched it a long time ago though, so I don't even remember the name anymore…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;Is it a tokusatsu DVD?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Of course not. I already get forced by Morisawa-senpai to watch a bunch of them…<br>I don't have to go out of my way to rent one, just asking that guy is enough… He'd even lend me bonus DVDs and whatnot… Not that I ever plan to borrow any from him…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;Good morning!!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Wah!? You scared me, Anzu-san… Good morning.<br>'You seemed down, so I tried greeting you energetically'…? Please don't become like Morisawa-senpai too…&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;What hurts the most?&quot;<br>💚&quot;How powerless I feel, and how it feels like all I'm doing is throwing tantrums… Or how Morisawa-senpai doesn't talk to his own unit about anything… Or how nothing's been working out for us… I don't even know anymore… What's hurting me so much…?&quot;</p><h3 id="Wedding-March">Wedding March!</h3><p>(31, complete)</p><p>❤️&quot;Heeey, Takamine!

I was looking for you.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh—You've got the wrong person, I'm not Takamine Midori…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! ☆ I never once said 'Midori,' and you won't fool me with that trick!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ugh… I'm tired enough as it is, why did I have to come across such an exhausting person… Did you want something from me?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mm? You look worn out… It isn't that big of a deal, so I can keep it for another day.&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, you can tell me now… I'm curious to hear what it is…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;No, you can tell me now… I'm curious to hear what it is, so…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Are you sure?

You should be proud of yourself!&quot;<br>💚&quot;It feels uncomfortable and gross that you kept watching me over and over again, but I guess it's whatever in the end. The video is out to the public, after all…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Do you and Sazanami-senpai know each other from something?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Well…The first time I met him was—&quot;<br>💚&quot;Wh—Why're you suddenly narrating a whole backstory… You don't have to tell me if it'll take forever.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Don't be like that! Isn't it good to learn more about other people?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh, really!? You're on close terms with Sazanami, then! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;I just said he's an acquaintance… Could you please try to listen to what I'm saying?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;That's what I understood from listening to you. Acquaintances don't typically lend each other their belongings, y'know?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! ☆ Your dad is happy to know that your friend circle has expanded so much more since the day he met you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;You're not my dad, though?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I just learned that you're getting along with Takamine over at your circle! ☆ As his senior from Ryuseitai, I really appreciate that! I'd love it if you could keep getting along with him!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Please don't act like my guardian, it's so embarrassing…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Sazanami-senpai, I heard you worked on a job with Morisawa-senpai. Wasn't it rough working with someone so obnoxious and suffocating?&quot;<br>🌊&quot;Not at all~ Morisawa-senpai is a real nice guy; he was always so considerate of me.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Yep, it was Ring.A.Bell's PV! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;I knew it… Please never recommend it to someone ever again.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Huh? But you let it slide just a moment ago, because 'the video is out to the public'…?&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's fine if someone else does it, but you're not allowed to.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Why's that!?&quot;</p><p>🌊(Ahaha, so this is how Takamine-kun's like when Morisawa-senpai's around, huh~ He acts a lot differently from how he is in Manga Club, so it kinda feels new to me…)</p><p>❤️&quot;—Found you, Takamine~! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;What do you want, Morisawa-senpai… If it's something pointless like the other day, I'm gonna tie you up to the tree in the courtyard, 'kay…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;What an elaborate punishment! It sounds like the sort of predicament a hero could find himself in.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Worry not! I have a proper reason why I wanted to see you. This is for you! Give me your hand.&quot;<br>💚&quot;A capsule toy of a mascot character!? And a super rare one at that!? Why, though? It's not even my birthday…<br>Oh, I see what this is. There's a catch to this, isn't there?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Ah, I see… You'd like me to join the project, since I have experience with bridal work…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep! We'd have a hundred men's worth of power on our side if you were with us!

I'm under a contract where I'm not allowed to take any bridal-related jobs for the year.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ahh… I suppose there's no working around that if that's the case…&quot;<br>💚&quot;You won't try to persist? That's not like you…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Well, there isn't much we can do about that, is there? Persisting won't change anything.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You won't try to persist? That's not like you…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Well, there isn't much we can do about that, is there? Persisting won't change anything. It's a shame, but I'll try to find someone else. See you then, Takamine.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Okay… Sorry, I kinda feel bad…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…Please wait a moment, Morisawa-senpai. Take this capsule toy back. I almost considered keeping it, but… I barely got to help you out, and I don't feel right taking it like this…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'd rather you keep the toy with you. It's already yours now!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Are you sure…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep! I don't have any reason to keep it, and I'm sure the mascot character would be much happier under the hands of someone who'd adore it! Think of it as me, and cherish it well…☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I don't have any reason to keep it, and I'm sure the mascot would be much happier under the hands of someone who'd adore it!

I'll try my best within my capabilities…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mhm, you've grown so much, Takamine! ☆ I'd love to ask for your help when the time comes!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I didn't expect Takamine to reject me… I was planning under the notion that he'd accept my invitation, so this is a hard hit on me.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Hold on, Morisawa-senpai's calling me. Hello…?<br>W-What the… All I hear is heavy breathing… Could you not play creepy pranks on me…?&quot;</p><p>💚(I wanna make things even between us after he gave me that capsule toy, so… Sazami-senpai's favorite food, huh… …Ah, maybe—)<br>— —<br>❤️&quot;…Ohh, I see! Thank you, Takamine!&quot;<br>👓&quot;What's this!? Player Morisawa has just used his 'call'!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;'I'll send you strawberries once they're in season'… Ah, from Takamine. It sounds like he's still bothered by his mistake.&quot;<br>🌊&quot;I don't blame him for thinking broccoli was my fav, though~ Could you also let him know that he doesn't have to worry about it?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mhm! I will.&quot;</p><h4 id="Mini-talks-5">Mini talks</h4><p>❤️&quot;Ohh! The pattern design on this marriage form is of that yuruchara Takamine's been into lately! It might make him happy if it was given to him!&quot;</p><h3 id="Parallel-World">Parallel World</h3><p>(1, complete)</p><p>❤️&quot;Do you mean Metalder!? Is this like another episodic story from Superhuman-Machine Metalder!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ughh, so annoying… I hate that this guy's tokusatsu nerdy side lit back up — probably 'cause things finally got sorted out for our unit…&quot;</p><h3 id="Tropical">Tropical</h3><p>(48, complete)</p><p>❤️&quot;Hahaha, Takamine, you've got so many thoughts to share with us, y'know? I feel like that's exactly why Nagumo chose you as the next in line.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You've never truly had an opportunity to stand out in the center, so if anything, I think that having you as our next commander would certainly demonstrate to the world that Ryuseitai has powered up, Takamine. I feel like it's a great opportunity!&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;If Midori-kun can't be the leader, I guess I'll go with someone else…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I'm always prepared to take the position! ☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;No, you're better off as a regular member for a while. Do you have any idea how long you've been acting as the leader…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;You see, Takamine lives right by my dorm room, and… He apparently hasn't been showing up in his room for the past few days. I only discovered this when Tenma-kun asked me if something had happened.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Either way, we won't know unless we ask him… I'm really worried. Although… While Takamine is typically one to conserve his energy, I can only hope that he's decided to travel about in order to train himself for the commander position.&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;Indeed. After all, Midori-kun might collapse if he frets too much all on his own. I, too, shall see if there are any eyewitness reports!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Thank you, that'd be a huge help. I'll be sure to message you all if I find out anything about him, too.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Excuuse meee!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Woah, what the hell!?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You seem down, Takamine! Your Ryuseitai comrades have come to your rescue! So let's all properly talk with one another! Now, come on, follow me!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh, don't just barge into someone's room! Nobody asked you to cheer me up, anyway!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;You can't just enter my room without permission!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Worry not, I didn't enter without permission. Your mother allowed me in!&quot;<br>💚&quot;M-Mom…!? Don't let this suffocating guy in here! Think a little more about how your own son would feel…!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Hahaha, no need to be so shy! Aren't we comrades who share the same spirit!? Everyone is waiting for you at the shop's entrance! If you don't come down, then we'll all just have to come to your room, Takamine…☆&quot;<br>💚&quot;Eeeep…!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;No need to be embarrassed! I've also decorated my room with sentai DVDs and figurines. Being passionate about your interests is a wonderful thing!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Don't talk to me all high and mighty after barging into my room… You're the one person I don't want coming here…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;So that's what it was… Sorry, we barged in without a regard for your actual reasons, Takamine. We thought that you might've been stressed about your leadership position, so we were prepared to lighten your burden if so, but—I see that it was all unfounded worry.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Fortunately, we can be flexible with our schedule for the unit right now. Let's group up again after you've taken a rest and recovered, Takamine.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I'm gonna rest for a little longer in my home… I'll let you guys know when I've recovered.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Got it. We're waiting for you, Takamine. Alright then, we'll be having basic practice sessions until you're back!&quot;<br>💙&quot;take your time, okay, midori? ♪&quot;</p><p>💙&quot;i do hope midori feels better after a bit of rest…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yeah… I'd like to believe that he'll come back to us in great shape, but since he's closed off his heart… The issue might linger. If push comes to shove, we may have to do another lottery to decide on the new leader.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;That makes sense. There's no need to force a decision on what you want to do in Ryuseitai. That sort of thing comes about naturally. Actually, maybe we should have given Takamine more time to think about his unit, too…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;…We need to keep this matter in mind. Takamine seems to be in low spirits due to something else, but even so, we should have given him more time.&quot;<br>💙&quot;that is true~ i only started to think about my own unit on the off chance that midori needs more time to rest…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It's almost a miracle that Takamine remained as an idol with us, after all. But I'm sure Takamine will bring a new color into Ryuseitai eventually. I believe in him!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;…Hm? I got a message from Anzu on Holdhands. Hmm…? Takamine is coming soon, so we should wait at the office…? I was so engrossed in our meeting that I didn't notice the message at all. It seems like she messaged me an hour ago, so—&quot;<br>💚&quot;……H-Hello.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm sure that you just didn't want to spoil our fun, right? You wanted to wait until we were done talking! How admirable of you, Takamine! ♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;……(Turns to leave)&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ah— Wait! I'm sorry if I offended you!&quot;<br>💚&quot;You really know how to hit on someone's nerve…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Is it alright if I talk to all of you about something?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Go for it! If it'll help you stand back up once more, then I'm willing to be a stepping stone or an outlet for your thoughts!&quot;<br>💚&quot;There's zero reason to be suffocating about this… Please just listen to me normally.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;My vision's not something as serious as Tetora-kun's vision was, y'know…? Are you really sure…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;There's no need to worry about that. Ryuseitai doesn't have to stick to only looking cool. Any form is the correct way to go about it, as long as it makes someone happy.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;…This is how I envision our new form of Ryuseitai.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ohh…? The stage is overflowing with the color green… Ah, I got it! We will protect nature… as RG!&quot;<br>💚&quot;That unit name isn't soft at all, so we're not going with it.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Oh, I see where you're going with this. That's why there are pages about our unit in the planning; it was to send it to the company. A mascot character sentai squad… That sounds really interesting.&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's not a sentai squad, though.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Besides, I'm not bold enough to try and convince people through sheer force the same way Morisawa-senpai does with sentai hero stuff… ……No, I'm getting negative again. I need to get myself together…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;I tend to push myself to perform as properly as possible, which honestly doesn't feel soft and fluffy at all…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I think it's fine to work as hard as you possibly can, though.&quot;<br>💚&quot;…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;It's because sentai shows are intended for children that they can't cut corners. It's that sort of fighting spirit that drives them to perform at their best. So I think it's perfectly fine for you to perform as hard as you possibly can, as a mascot character, Takamine.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Um, mascots and sentai heroes are entirely different things, though…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Wh—…! Well, um, you're right about that, but…! What I mean to say is, you don't need to hold back with us… You're welcome to go full force with me!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;If only I had a bit more confidence… If I could just lead Ryuseitai the same way Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun did, maybe I wouldn't need to worry… But as soon as it's on me to teach everyone what to do, I start to feel like I'm not capable to lead them…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine looks so happy today. It's almost unbelievable that he was depressed just a few days ago.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Don't mind me, Morisawa-senpai! Just look at Pop-dayuu!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hahaha, you're right. Your hero is finally here, after all — It would be rude to have my eyes elsewhere.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Pop-dayuu~!! Wave at me, too! (waves)&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahh, stop, you're way too loud…!! The star of this show is Pop-dayuu, y'know!?&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Woah, Midori-kun is dead serious…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Right then, Takamine! What do we have to do next? We'd love to know more! Tell us everything about your love for mascot characters…☆&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine, watch my performance, too! Look, what do you think of my Plateypus form!? 'I WANNA EAT SOME TASTY FOOD-PLATEY!!!'&quot;<br>💚&quot;That's way too forceful!! Are you messing around here, Morisawa-senpai!? Yelling like that is a disservice to Plateypus, you hear me!?&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;That's way too forceful!! Are you messing around here, Morisawa-senpai!? Yelling like that is a disservice to Plateypus, you hear me!?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Sorry, I just tried to say it in an energetic way—I didn't mean to look as though I'm messing around…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;H-How about now? That was good, wasn't it?&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Midori-kun, I'd like to know your thoughts, too! It was tricky on my own, but actin' out a conversation with Morisawa-senpai made me loosen up a li'l, I think!&quot;<br>💚&quot;U-Um… I do think you've gotten better from the first take, but…&quot;</p><p>💚(Mm~… I feel like Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun aren't getting adjusted to Yuruseitai after all… But, well, it also took a while for me to get used to acting like a villain for RB, so I can't talk like I'm any better…)</p><p>💚(I feel like I'm getting tired way faster, probably 'cause I'm leading the unit right now… I don't have as much stamina as Morisawa-senpai, so I think I'm gonna have to take a break every few days.)</p><p>❤️&quot;Sengoku, what do I have to do in order to become a much more soothing presence…!? I'm not doing enough to create the atmosphere that Takamine desires! I also want to give off a gentle aura, just like you and Kanata!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I was expecting something much softer for Yuruseitai's stage, but… was this also what you had in mind from the start?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Where were you looking, Morisawa-senpai? I only told you guys to relax and take it easy; I never once said anything about becoming a mascot character…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I see. So all along, you cherished my likes, too. I'm fired up now! I'll do my absolute best to ensure I convey your likes to the whole venue…!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahaha. Sure, but if you start to stiffen up again, I'll get angry, okay…? ♪&quot;</p><p>❤️(You did incredible work, Takamine. You truly give off the aura of a commander. But… Haha, it's sort of a bizarre sight to dance alongside mascot characters.)</p><p>💚&quot;Ahh, I'm so depressed…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You seem to have surpassed your limits during Tropical Live, Takamine. But it'll be alright! Now that you've conquered your duties as commander, you can definitely do anything!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Please don't try to beat a corpse back to life…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Ooh, and there's even a mascot company who watched our live show, and has sent a request for us to collaborate with their mascot…? This is wonderful news, Takamine. Your likes seems to have brought us new encounters~♪&quot;</p><h4 id="Mini-talks-6">Mini talks</h4><p>🎀&quot;I think greeting properly is important.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ahh, yes, that's the absolute basics. Morisawa-senpai also often says that 'Greetings are crucial! ☆' — Though when it comes to him, I think what he needs to be focusing on is the volume of his voice.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Takamine couldn't bear to watch my attempts at being soft, so he introduced me to a mascot character that resembles me. It's an octopus mascot that wants to be a police officer. Despite its earnest, fiery choice of words, it moves in a droopy, adorable way.&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;The mascot really is cute.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Isn't it? Honestly, I didn't expect to get this attached to it, but… Takamine introduced me to this character just for my sake. Just that thought alone makes it look all the more adorable to me.&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;The mascot's like a teacher to you, huh?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Oh, a teacher…! I like that! I should call this character my teacher from now on!<br>Ah, but… Takamine might scold me and warn me not to give it my own nickname…&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Now that I've finished warming up, I'm in perfect shape to show off all the softness Takamine hammered into me to the maximum! It's time to let aside being cool and fiery, and instead perform in a fun, cheerful, and super soft way~♪&quot;</p><p>🎀&quot;I'm looking forward to it.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yeah, I'm also excited for you to witness Ryuseitai under Takamine's lead! I'm sure you have a lot of work as a producer, but still, I hope you can watch over us until the very end! ☆&quot;</p><h3 id="Stella-Maris">Stella Maris</h3><p>(18, complete)</p><p>🖤&quot;Aight, I'd like to mention this upfront: Morisawa-senpai, you stink, so please don't get near me.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;That's so mean!? Eh? Eh!? Takamine keeps criticizing me for stinking of sweat, so I've been really careful, though…!?&quot;<br>🖤&quot;The amount of deodorant you use is way too much.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I really am! I'm a delicate guy, like a fruit that rots from wherever it's touched!&quot;<br>💚&quot;……Morisawa Durian Chiaki.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Don't call me by the name of a stinky fruit in a whisper! That's bullying! There's bullying taking place in Ryuseitai…!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Durians are also delicious fruits, though… They're the king of fruits…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Oh! So what you were trying to say is that I may have my weak points, but I have my strong points too, Takamine! You sure are bad at compliments!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Don't stray too far, Takamine. We may not be able to find each other again if we lose track of each other. Here; if you're feeling anxious, big brother will gladly hold your hand~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;…tch…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;He clicked his tongue!? Why!? I really was trying to be considerate, though…!?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Here; if you're feeling anxious, big brother will gladly hold your hand~♪&quot;<br>💚&quot;…tch…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;He clicked his tongue!? Why!? I really was trying to be considerate, though…!?&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Midori-kun doesn't wanna be treated like a li'l kid either, y'know~♪&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;M-Morisawa-senpai looks oddly reliable… Even though he's just Morisawa-senpai…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I'm a guy you can always rely on! But of course, this job is focused around Kanata, our commander — so I'm trying not to meddle too much!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;Don't call me by sama… Master Artist calls me by that too, but I'm nobody important…&quot;<br>🔹&quot;But I must show respect to my elders.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;How admirable! Takamine, you should learn from him! I want you to show me more respect!<br>💚&quot;When have you ever done something respectable, huh?&quot;</p><p>🔹&quot;Fufu. Midori-sama's extremely perceptive. Incredible… You understand how I feel.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Of course! Takamine's incredible! He's a perceptive boy who can sense and understand all the subtleties in someone's delicate heart! Thank you! For appreciating Takamine's wonderful trait…!&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Of course! Takamine is incredible! He's a perceptive boy who can sense and understand all the subtleties within someone's delicate heart! I have to thank you! For appreciating Takamine's wonderful trait…!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Why are you so proud of that.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I'm the one who raised Takamine!&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;There's really not that many great things lying around outside the island either, though.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hey now! Don't interrupt the conversation with unpleasant comments! Now you're showing your bad trait, Takamine!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Hmph, so sorry for being negative…&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;zzz… zzz…♪&quot;<br>❤️(And Takamine, sound asleep~ Whew, I'm so glad they're all sleeping nice and peacefully.)<br>💚&quot;Just die.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;—……!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mngh… (mumble, mumble)… Fools who defy mascots will face the death penalty~… zzz…♪&quot;<br>❤️(Whew. He was just sleep talking.)</p><p>🖤&quot;Ossu, we're good there. It's just that Shinkai-senpai is unusually over-excited, so we were kinda surprised in a way.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Right…? We've got enough of that from Morisawa-senpai, y'know… I'd prefer it if Shinkai-senpai always stays as the healing presence, being floaty and taking it easy…&quot;</p><p>❤️→💙&quot;You've been flowing along with whatever I wanted to do for so long. It's now my turn to do the same.&quot;<br>———<br>💚→💙&quot;When I was made to be the commander, everyone gave their absolute best from start to end. It's now my turn to do the same, right? Mhm, probably…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Fufu.&quot;</p><p>💚&quot;No more fish… No more fish…&quot;<br>💛&quot;Ah— Midori-kun is reliving his trauma again!?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Are you alright, Takamine!? Look, here are some vegetables! Fresh, spring vegetables…!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Uu, uu— Vegetables? Not fish…?&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;Even tokusatsu heroes don't ever one-sidedly eradicate evil without question.&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's overbearing how Senpai compares everything to tokusatsu… But, well, I get what you're trying to say.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm not proud of taking on such an unheroic, underhanded method. After all, we took everyone outside of Hoshijima in the form of a surprise attack—&quot;<br>💙&quot;fufu. what are you saying, when you are the same person who would always force midori outside?&quot;</p><h4 id="Mini-talks-7">Mini talks</h4><p>💙&quot;i feel like if i got to see tetora and shinobu, it would soothe me…♪&quot;<br>🎀&quot;Shall we invite the other two?&quot;<br>💙&quot;do you mean chiaki and midori? it is about time for their job to end, yes~? okay, i will contact them from my side. i hope we can all gather and talk together…♪&quot;</p><h3 id="Ryuseitai-Album-TRIP">Ryuseitai Album TRIP</h3><p>(8, complete)</p><p>❤️&quot;If we could, I'd love to sing it another ten more times…!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ten…?

Now I'll have more things to deal with…&quot;<br>💛&quot;Things to deal with? …Mm? What're you checking on your phone?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm? I'm just going through different forms of contact and social media, and blocking all of Morisawa-senpai's accounts.&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;…Mm? Midori-kun, what are you checking on your phone?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Mm? I'm just going through different forms of contact and social media, and blocking all of Morisawa-senpai's accounts, is all.&quot;<br>💛&quot;That would have Morisawa-dono in tears if he knew.&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;Not to mention, didn't you block his number too, Midori-kun?&quot;<br>💙&quot;uu~… because of that, chiaki comes to me to relay every one of his messages as a [mediator], and it is such a [bother], so i would much rather it stops.&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;We gathered in the common room to cheer Morisawa-senpai on, remember? Midori-kun's meant to be cheerin' him on too, so what's the point in blockin' him?

What's up, Midori-kun?&quot;<br>💚&quot;He's singing a weird song, and the dance looks really gross… I thought for sure he'd be getting slandered online, so I tried looking it up…&quot;<br>🖤&quot;He really looks up 'Morisawa Chiaki' immediately…&quot;</p><p>🖤&quot;He really looks up 'Morisawa Chiaki' immediately…&quot;<br>💚&quot;Okay, yeah, I do… But I mean, it's fine, isn't it? That guy always instantly neglects keeping contact when he has a long-term job, for one thing. Someone needs to monitor him, right…?&quot;</p><p>💛&quot;If that's what you say, then it's really puzzling why you block him.

What did you see after looking up Morisawa-dono?&quot;<br>💚&quot;It looks like this weird song is going viral on a massive scale on social media… It's number 1 on the trending page.

Well, I can't say it's not like Morisawa-senpai to end up like this, though…&quot;</p><p>🦢&quot;Feels like Ryuseitai's pretty chill about all of this…? You aren't worried or anxious by the possibility of Morisawa-senpai losing in the audition?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Won't he be fine?

If it's a ninja-related job, then Sengoku would be leader, and if it's a cooking show that uses vegetables, then Takamine would be leader.&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I especially recommend the—… Uuu… S-Sorry.

It's only making the conversation convoluted…!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hahaha, it's been a while since Takamine's been this harsh with me. I now truly feel like I've come back to Ryuseitai…♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;I'm so glad this is ending on a good note. Of course, we can't keep our guard down until we're back, though.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Seriously… But I'm glad to know the staff are safe.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yeah, definitely. With this, we've accomplished our duty as heroes…♪&quot;</p><p>❤️&quot;In that case, I'll be the one to act as a decoy… While I've got the lion distracted, you all get Nagumo into the car.&quot;<br>💚&quot;Are you an idiot!?

You aren't even my girlfriend, but I'm still so happy!&quot;<br>💚&quot;……&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;Ughhh, this crane game is impossible… I'm sorry, Hanemaru-chan…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Fuhahaha! Fear not, Takamine! I've practiced just for this day! I'll make sure to get that stuffed toy for you!&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;Takamine~! You scored so many goals today! I'm so glad to see you having fun~!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Agh—! Gross, don't hug me when you're all sweaty… I just happened to make the goal, that's all…&quot;<br>🎸(Takamine, I can see your smile from a mile away…)</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;T-Takaminee~!? What is that…!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Oh, this? Since it's October, they're selling a bunch of Halloween-themed mascot characters… Hehe, isn't it cute~ Here, you can have this one~♪&quot;<br>❤️&quot;No, no! I'm good, thanks!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh, you'd refuse a present from your junior…?&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>🖤&quot;Yo, Midori-kun, sorry I couldn't come. Did I miss anything?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh, so much… Morisawa-senpai wouldn't stop bugging me, and then he even followed me home and wouldn't leave… I'm so tired…&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Uh, I meant if I missed anything from practice…?&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️(…Lately, hugging Takamine makes me feel strange inside, and I don't know why…)<br>—<br>💚(……Morisawa-senpai hasn't been pestering me lately… Something feels off…)</p><p>-Fanon<br>💙&quot;chiaki~ what's that on your arm?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ohh, this? I had a slight scratch, so Takamine gave me one of his bandaids!&quot;<br>💙&quot;ohh… fufu, you're very loved by him~&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You think so…? No, I'd hope so! He's a very precious comrade, after all!&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;Melonbow's dance was super cute~ She was shy, but she let me take pictures with her after the show, and…Um, what is it?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Hm?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Why're you smiling like that… Did I say something weird?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Not at all! I was just thinking how it's actually you who's super cute!&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;You sure do like fries, huh…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Yep! Here, let me share some with you! Say 'Ahh'!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Wha—Quit it, I don't want any…!&quot;<br>❤️&quot;You sure…? I promise they're tasty.&quot;<br>💚&quot;—! Ughh… F-Fine, I'll have one…&quot;<br>💚(He totally just used his puppy-dog eyes on me…)</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;Ughhh, so cooolddd… I need something to warm me up…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Should I turn the heater on?&quot;<br>💚&quot;…I'd rather something I could wrap around me…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ohhh! Then maybe a blanket?&quot;<br>💚&quot;……&quot;<br>❤️&quot;T-Two blankets…!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;…(Get a clue, Senpai…)&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;Haaah~ It's sooo cold…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ohh? Do you need my scarf?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ehh, no… Then you'll just be cold… I'd rather you hug me than that—… Wait no, I mean—&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Takamine~!! I'll gladly hug you super tight and warm you up!&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;Takamine, rise and shine!

Sleeping in my arms tonight? There, there~&quot;<br>💚&quot;Only 'cause you kept begging me to…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;What, I was simply offering it out of love!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Hmph… Whatever, you're finally relying on me, so I'll let it slide… Good night, Senpai.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Wait, what do you mean I'm… Huh!?&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;…Senpai, you've been at it all night. Let's sleep already…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Mm~ I'll just practice my lines one last ti—Ah! My glasses…!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Put the script down and rest… This bed is too big for me alone, y'know…&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;Ugh, this is so annoying… That guy's got a full schedule next week… Now he definitely won't be texting us for a while… Sigh, why's he always like this…?&quot;<br>🖤&quot;Uh, Midori-kun? I know Morisawa-senpai's important and all, but we're here to discuss our plans, 'kay?&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;How's your food, Takamine?&quot;<br>💚&quot;It tastes good… Here, have a bite.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Sure! —Oh, it really is tasty!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Try this, too.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Alright! —This one's tasty too!&quot;<br>💚&quot;And this one.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;??

(Why's he so close…!? Wait, is it a k-ki—)&quot;<br>💚&quot;It's Pompom-purin's custard~ …What's wrong?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;No, I just thought… N-Nevermind!!&quot;<br>💚(Hehe, seeing him get flustered is so much fun…♪)</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;Takamine, we should check out the new hero show together!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Nah, not in the mood…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I promise you'll have fun! We'll have dinner afterwards. It'll be my treat!&quot;<br>💚&quot;…Senpai, if you wanna go on a date, just say so.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;—!? N-No, I-I just thought it'd be fun…!&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;Nngh… Eggplants are the one thing I can't eat…&quot;<br>💚&quot;Then don't eat it…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;I'd be wasting my food…! But I can't finish it, either!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Ugh, what a pain… Give me your plate already…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Huh? What're you—&quot;<br>💚&quot;Here, my plate's only got greens, so it should be fine…&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>🦢&quot;Oh my gosh, Morisawa-senpai's cover shot looks sooo ra-vely~!&quot;<br>💚&quot;Oh, right, that… I heard it's gonna be used as a promotion for something big soon…&quot;<br>🦢&quot;W-Whaaat!? That's totally news to me! Where'd you get this info!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Huh? I thought this was common knowledge…?&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;I'm so sorry, Takamine…! I really didn't mean to ruin it! I'll buy you a new one!&quot;<br>💚&quot;…It was a limited edition plushie…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Urk…! Is there any other way I can make it up to you…?&quot;<br>💚&quot;…Be my pillow instead and I might forgive you…&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Alright, I'll d—Wait, huh!?&quot;</p><p>-Fanon<br>💚&quot;Wha—Senpai!? Why're you in the rain without an umbrella!?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;Ah, there was an old man who lost his, and—&quot;<br>💚&quot;Sigh, why're you always like this…? Get under mine. Now.&quot;<br>❤️&quot;E-Eh? Takamine, did I do something wrong…?&quot;<br>💚(When will you get it through your thick skull…)</p><p>-Fanon<br>❤️&quot;Takamine, is that fries I see!?&quot;<br>💚&quot;Yeah, you had a long day today, so I figured you'd want s——<br>……U-Um, why'd you kiss me all of a sudden…?&quot;<br>❤️&quot;—Ahh, s-sorry!
