HAPPY TO HEAR THAT!! i love considering stuff based on canon, there is so much to work off of...</p><p>i know i took a long time to answer this, but the question is very interesting because something fun about midochia is that it's not really a topic of &quot;do they love each other? do they want to be together forever?&quot; but rather &quot;do they realize they love each other <em>in that way?</em>&quot; and it's even MORE interesting on midori's side.</p><p>in terms of &quot;do midochia love each other?&quot; it's yes, and &quot;do they know they're loved by the other?&quot; it's also yes. by the end of his first year, midori realizes chiaki's love for him is 100% legit and was never going to fade off once he &quot;disappoints&quot; chiaki, chiaki genuinely loves him deep down for who he is and <em>that's</em> why he wants to see him become a hero. on the other hand, comet show is when chiaki realizes he's loved by midori. he spent so many months, even back in ! era, possibly thinking midori doesn't care about him (and especially doesn't care about him as much as midori cares for the other members), but by the end of comet show he realizes once and for all, midori loves and cares for him so much.</p><p>&quot;do they want to be together forever?&quot; absolutely 100% yes, this is such a big theme of ryuseitai's arc in general, they all want to be together for as long as physically possible, and these two were at the center of that arc considering midori intentionally stopped chiaki from leaving ryuseitai. he did EVERYTHING in his power to make sure chiaki doesn't give up his hero dream</p><p>so what is so fascinating is... does midori <em>realize</em> so many of his actions toward chiaki are fueled by special love for chiaki? does midori realize he <em>loves</em> chiaki?</p><p>and i think the answer is yes and no. it's a bit complicated because midori is extremely layered. fortunately i've answered an ask somewhat related to this before <a href="https://x.com/0918justice/status/1734588979603742841" target="_blank">right here</a>, but it's 2 years old by now and i want to do a re-take on the whole topic (especially because a couple of my interpretations changed after so many more new stories came out), so this is an improved version of that ask!</p><p>THAT BEING SAID i absolutely love what anon said in that ask, so i do want to at least copy paste that again as part of this topic:</p><blockquote><p>An interesting aspect of Midori's relationship with Chiaki that I enjoy thinking about is that for as much as Midori often tries to be straightforward and direct with Chiaki regarding how he feels (telling him to watch him closely, trying to tell him he won't think differently of him if he showed his weak side, etc) Midori also seems reluctant to admit those feelings at the same time? If anyone else brings up &quot;oh Midori you're pretty close to Chiaki right? you miss him don't you?&quot; his immediate response is to refute it and even occassionally feels violent over the idea. He seems incapable of realizing that &quot;I always search what Morisawa-senpai is up to online and have memorized a bunch of stuff about him&quot; isn't...ordinary, to put it nicely. Especially for someone he claims he's not obsessed with, he just wants to be sure Chiaki's not badmouthing him, honest! It's such a fun part of who Midori is. That he is both direct about how he truly feels about Chiaki and yet also very stubborn about not wanting to be honest about it. It seems contradictory and like it wouldn't work as a character trait for him, and yet the writing makes it so that both can be true and real and make sense for who Midori is as a person and how layered his relationship with Chiaki is.</p></blockquote><p>-anon on dec 11, 2023</p><p>YESS YES YES YES YES i have a personal interpretation of how he manages to be both at the same time.</p><p>firstly i agree, i love the seeming contradiction between the two traits, yet in reality it really gives depth to his character!</p><p>secondly, ABSOLUTELY YES, part of why he's like this is because he doesn't <em>realize</em> it. in regards to the egosearching, i feel like he doesn't fully understand that he's coping with the loss of chiaki, even though he's always talking about how he's so MIA now and it sucks. but also, he's trying his best to come to understand his feelings too!!</p><p>midori is straightforward with his feelings towards chiaki. when given the opportunity, he just expresses them as they are. those same feelings though, are intense and messy, and also come from all sorts of places. his emotional dependancy on chiaki that he's trying his best NOT to do anymore because of his desire to repay chiaki (to be reliable for him, to support him, to ease his burdens)... and then, his exhaustion being with an &quot;energetic loud&quot; chiaki, but also the attachment and endearment he has towards him existing in his life and being by his side... it goes on and on and on... every feeling has its own layer, and then that has its own layer, and it's so beautiful.</p><p>and that's something so important here: that there are many emotions and feelings he's going through. some of them he doesn't realize, some he hasn't fully understood, and some that he knows what it is and is trying his best to convey to chiaki. and he is CONSTANTLY trying to make sense of his emotions and get closer to achieving what he wants to do for chiaki (repay him, give him the same type of unconditional acceptance as chiaki did to him, etc.), but it takes SO LONG because HIS FEELINGS FOR CHIAKI ARE THAT MASSIVE. (also because chiaki has 39535 defensive walls that are keeping midori out but that's a different topic)</p><p>but... in terms of a label, what <em>would</em> you call these feelings? what on earth IS midori feeling for chiaki? he is literally feeling EVERY EMOTION EVER TO EXIST when coming into contact with chiaki. anger, happiness, sadness, confidence, irritation, infatuation, worry, relief... it's ENDLESS. no wonder midori doesn't know or doesn't realize what he's feeling towards chiaki. there's just too many to register at once in the first place</p><p>then someone sees him be that way and then says &quot;oh, you really miss him, huh?&quot; or &quot;you love him so much huh~&quot; or even chiaki himself says any of those things... and it angers him so much</p><p>here's where my own interpretation based on the text starts. because midori doesn't know what these feelings are, having people slap a label and move on, before he even gets to fully digest them, frustrates him.</p><p>it's like people are now designating how he feels. for one thing, a single-word label such as &quot;love&quot; doesn't even come <em>close</em> to describing his feelings, so i feel like it frustrates him to hear ppl summarize it as just &quot;love&quot;. for another, we know from his stories that midori has always despised the image others have of him and place on him, he hates the expectation that comes with that image, for ex. &quot;well midori is strong and handsome, so he must be very capable&quot;... and he hates that it always leads to disappointment for &quot;failing to meet&quot; said expectations.</p><p>and for yet Another thing... midori's experience with love, especially romantic love, is complicated due to his bad experiences of girls being interested in him for his looks then getting disappointed when they find out his true self. this is another reason why i feel like &quot;love&quot; feels wrong in his mouth, as he's never even experienced the feelings of love and caring for others (outside of your family) before, not until ryuseitai. and he took a whole <em>year</em> of being with ryuseitai, and then being yelled at by tetora, to come to an understanding of his feelings towards ryuseitai. it's no surprise that it's taking him a long time to digest all these feelings he has for chiaki, considering it's on an even bigger and messier scale</p><p>but most of all.... considering how much midori despises being defined based on uncontrollable traits (his height, his good looks)... i can see why it also annoys him when others define things for him <em>when he's still trying to make sense of them himself</em>. i think one of my favorite examples is in <a href="https://310mc.github.io/sweet_halloween/">sweet halloween</a>:</p><p><strong>Midori:</strong> &quot;Mm~… Hey, is it just me, or is Morisawa-senpai acting weird lately…?&quot;<br><strong>Shinobu:</strong> &quot;Is he not always weird?&quot;<br><strong>Midori:</strong> &quot;No, I meant it like… he’s not acting like himself… It’s like he’s always scared of something… He seems so nervous over everything that he's overwhelmed… He doesn’t even pester me as much as he used to…&quot;<br><strong>Tetora:</strong> &quot;Oh? Could it be that you're feeling lonely~? 'Cuz he's not paying attention to you~♪&quot;<br><strong>Midori:</strong> &quot;……&quot;<br><strong>Shinobu:</strong> &quot;Wh—!? What are you going to do with that hammer, Midori-kun!? You could kill someone with that, you know!?&quot;</p><p>hilarious scene aside, i like to see this as midori getting intensely enraged because he was being SO serious right now. he's genuinely baffled by how chiaki's acting, he doesn't understand what changed in the environment for chiaki to suddenly &quot;not be pestering him as much&quot;. yes, his observation that chiaki isn't around him and being annoying was indeed out of worry, but also out of general confusion. so when tetora teased him, (and teased him for his <em>wording</em> too) saying &quot;oh? (so he hasn't been pestering you?) could it be you're feeling lonely (without that)~?&quot;, something about that made midori snap (i'm so sorry tetora you don't deserve that). because HE'S 100% SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT THIS, IT'S <em>NOT</em> A JOKE TO HIM.</p><p>the best part? this makes midori's feelings towards chiaki even <em>more</em> fascinating and layered. because this means he wasn't angry out of &quot;how dare you say i love <em>HIM</em>&quot; but &quot;um, i'm being genuinely serious right now, i don't know why he's acting this way and i'm talking to you two about it because i thought you could help me figure it out, but okay, i see how it is, i'm just ~feeling lonely~ 😐&quot;. like... okay but that's still gay th--</p><p>(i could also talk about how his reactions to chiaki's &quot;oh you love me&quot; comments are even MORE aggressive than the above example, but that's a whole topic of its own and is more related to how chiaki constantly puts his walls up with midori, which has been exhausting midori)</p><p>so before i start going in circles with this ramble, all i'm trying to say here is... i interpret all of this as this: midori HIMSELF will decide what his feelings are. he won't let ANYONE define it, not even chiaki. only he himself knows what he's feeling, or rather, only he himself is going <em>through</em> those feelings, so even if he doesn't know, he's allowed to take his time to make sense of them! because only HE can find the correct answer that properly suits all these emotions chiaki makes him go through. something that isn't just love, but also devotion, gratitude, repayment, even the irritation he feels when he sees chiaki close up or be Way Too Loud...</p><p>this is also why i fucking LOOOOVEEEEEEE this <a href="https://310mc.github.io/supervillain">supervillain</a> scene:</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> &quot;I can’t even reach a signal, no matter how many times I phone him.&quot;<br><strong>Midori:</strong> &quot;It’s not ‘cause you were so annoying that he blocked you… right?&quot;<br><strong>Chiaki:</strong> &quot;Nope! I think it’s only you who’d do something as cruel as that to me, Takamine! I’ll have you know, it’s a burden on me to always have to relay my messages to other people like Kanata whenever I want to contact you!&quot;<br><strong>Midori:</strong> &quot;It’s an honor to know that I was able to become special to you, Senpai.&quot;<br><strong>Chiaki:</strong> &quot;Mhm! I’d love it if we could become special in a more positive way! You little rascal~! ♪&quot;</p><p>NOOOBOOOODYYYYYYYY would interpret, define, or label &quot;blocking someone's phone number&quot; as love or being lonely. nobody would think of that as a form of love (hell, chiaki even replies to him that he wishes they could be special in a <em>positive</em> way!)</p><p>but to midori? this is his opportunity. he has finally found some way to be &quot;special&quot; to his senpai. he is now the only person to have blocked him, the only person that chiaki has to go through so much efforts to contact... &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; connotations don't matter for someone who prefers to live his life as his true natural self rather than a &quot;perfect image that society approves of, that is part of society's norms&quot;. so of COURSE this is an <em>honor</em> to him. he's insane. i love him. i LOVE him!!!!!!!! HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHIAKI IS SO LAYERED BECAUSE IT SHOWS EVERY LAYER OF MIDORI I LOVE HIMMMM</p><p>(gosh i really hope this made sense, feel free to ask for clarification if not... it took me a bit to figure out how to word this all out because my love for midori is a bundle of messy emotions just like him.... i love him...)&quot;,</p><p>yeah that's a really interesting question lmao 😭 i think though, he is sooo rejective of the &quot;norm&quot; type of love. like &quot;butterflies = in love&quot; or, &quot;you can't stop thinking about them = in love&quot;, i feel like he'd hate the idea of whatever he's feeling towrads chiaki is just &quot;you're in love&quot;. and it makes him in denial of it even more bc it doesn't feel right. like that's not how he can describe all these feelings chiaki makes him feel<br>so i think the way he'd realize he's in love is by not even referring to it as such, and it being him referring to it as. idk. &quot;i want to be with morisawa-senpai for the rest of my life&quot; . something like that<br>like that realization that he can never see himself Without him, and he doesnt want it, and knowing chiaki wouldn't want that (and wouldn't want to be away from rst) would make him want it even stronger<br>i think for midori he also needs to realize how chiaki feels about him. bc i get this sense, based on the stories, that midori Has No Fucking Clue the true reason why chiaki treats him so special. he keeps thinking its for negative reasons like &quot;bc im not good enough&quot; &quot;bc im still a kid who needs his help&quot; &quot;bc im nto reliable enough&quot; like he's always going for the worst interpretation of chiaki's attention on him. even in comet show he's like &quot;ik u paid most attention to me in repayfes bc i was the worst out of us juniors but they deserve praise and love too&quot; LIKE THAT IS LEGIT HOW HE PERCEIVES WHY CHIAKI PUT SO MUCH ATTENTION ON HIM</p><p>i think when he realizes How chiaki actually loves him, which is &quot;i want to be in your life as an equal, as life partners&quot; i thnk that's when so much of his brain will start. going back on Every single thing about chiaki and like. wait. wait so all that? all that bs he'd keep doing..... are u telling me it was all bc he wanted that?????<br>im soo sorry for the roundabout answer. it's something i really love about midochia and i'm really passionate about how midochia is so much about these two ppl who LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH and they know they love each other AND THEY KNOW THE OTHER LOVES THEM BACK and yet they still have these clashes that clearly come from wanting SO MUCH MORE FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP, clearly they want more than just Senpai Kouhai, or Guardian &amp; Kid or whatever else. so they keep searching and searching and Trying and Trying, what is it that the two want from each other, it's never enough so what is it</p><p>and midori's constant rejections leading to chiaki just trying NEW ways to bond with him and connect with him (until we reached the insane gourmet scene, holy shit) is just AUGHHHHH<br>bc another thing is that, midori rejects chiaki, and chiaki tends to go &quot;what was i suppose to do here!?' but midori never gives an answer. and i think its bc midori doesnt know what it is either. he just knows its Not That. Nope. and stubborn chiaki just keeps trying again but from a different angle. okay he rejecte dad/mom/grandpa, what about big bro n__n to show him i see us as equals and i rely on him like a brother n___n and nope still wasnt enough for midori!<br>ermmm tl;dr i think the world will explode when they realize that the way they love each other is as life partners who will be there in each other's lives forever 🤓</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Question-and-Answer/" rel="tag">#Question and Answer</a></div></footer></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy; <span itemprop="copyrightYear">2026</span> <span class="with-love"><i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i> </span><span class="author" itemprop="copyrightHolder">Unlimited Galaxy</span></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animejs@3.2.1/lib/anime.min.js" integrity="sha256-XL2inqUJaslATFnHdJOi9GfQ60on8Wx1C2H8DYiN1xY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/comments.js"></script><script src="/js/utils.js"></script><script src="/js/motion.js"></script><script src="/js/next-boot.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-generator-searchdb@1.4.0/dist/search.js" integrity="sha256-vXZMYLEqsROAXkEw93GGIvaB2ab+QW6w3+1ahD9nXXA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/third-party/search/local-search.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quicklink@2.2.0/dist/quicklink.umd.js" integrity="sha256-4kQf9z5ntdQrzsBC3YSHnEz02Z9C1UeW/E9OgnvlzSY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script class="next-config" data-name="quicklink" type="application/json">{"enable":true,"home":true,"archive":false,"delay":true,"timeout":3000,"priority":true,"ignores":"/\\/categories\\/?/, /\\/tags\\/?/,","url":"https://unlimited-galaxy.github.io/20250620_4/"}</script><script src="/js/third-party/quicklink.js"></script></body></html>
