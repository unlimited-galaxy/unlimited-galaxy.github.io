Chiaki?</p><p>so it&#39;s not like i don&#39;t have the will to help you.</p></div></div><p>Man I love Supernova Kanata but also wow I can see why Kanata saw Midori and nodded hm<br>Yes he can do what I couldn’t.<br>Cuz this attitude of his in Supernova is very similar to Midori lmao<br>No real “motivation” towards heroes or anything but “for Chiaki I would do it”… 😌<br>This too… Chiaki being ???? With Kanata’s wording and not being sure what he means.<br>It really explains why Chiaki always was scared that he was just dragging everyone along his<br>Dreams by force…<br>Hes so funny yet so cute… he really just doesn’t care that much about the bad guys and it<br>Doesn’t help that he grew scared of them as well<br>But I love how here Midoris just 😐 (respect gone down another negative 100) but Tetora<br>Actually gets Chiakis perspective<br>Midori: how is it possible to have this much energy<br>Shinobu: I think cause he didn't sleep well<br>Midori, a lightbulb clicking in his head: oh now I see (this guys just a regular person like<br>Anyone else)<br>The more logic Midori finds to Chiaki’s actions the more he’s like hm. you're really nothing special<br>Huh (and that makes him fall in love w Chiaki more)<br>Chiaki’s vision of villains being something thats just an act / pretend vs Kanata who can’t<br>“pretend” to be a monster when he actually is one … thinks<br>Tho I feel like I finally get the nuance of this line perfectly Chiaki made him understand<br>That such a miracle can exist<br>I wonder if its a foreshadowing to his future arc as well tho…<br>Makes me wish Supernova could be rewritten with meteor impact’s existence but I’ll take this<br>Prologue<br>It really goes to show how Chiaki tried to guide and lead them through everything even<br>Things he didn’t really know anything about<br>Actually something else I just noticed.. When Midoris going all oh 🤔 thats why his eyes look red,<br>Tetora makes a comment to himself (which I think was serious like “oh damn he's literally<br>Ryusei red /gen”) and Shinobu laughs but Midori doesn't comment on it<br>But when Kanatas all rawr he joins along and says cute<br>Shinobu finding the situation very light-hearted and silly whereas Midori and Tetora both are<br>Like 🤔🤔🤔🤔 in different ways @ Chiaki<br>And then of course w Kanata… its Kanata so they have no further comments past “omg cute”<br>The fact Tetora’s comment is like “oh huh his eyes are red… like ryusei red” feels relevant lol<br>Especially since he makes the same comment in supervillain but it was much more light-hearted<br>And a genuine joke than it was here<br>Like Midoris just like oh ! Right right yeah you do get weirdly hyper when you dont sleep<br>Nodnod now I understand why he's being a weirdo<br>But Tetoras like ooo red … cuz he's ryusei red… (narration: he doesn't know he ends up being<br>Pulled into the curse of the red color)<br>But in supervillain, the comment feels less &quot;&quot;Foreshadowing&quot;&quot; of something, and more &quot;Tetora<br>Just being a little shit to Midori&quot; which is cute<br>Kanata…<br>Just because the hero exists, doesn't mean he should take advantage of his kindness…<br>This is the funniest exchange ever<br>Kanata: I'm a pro heh<br>Chiaki: I can recite every moment yo've almost drowned in water<br>Chiaki you're killing me I swear to god /neg ugh.<br>One reason I delayed reading Comet Show was because it means going thru Chiaki exhibiting 500<br>Red flags when talking to Kanata . But I must trudge through…<br>Ugh I can't I'm just so (shakes him) no. I must calm down. Things get better for him. Midori<br>Helps him. Ryuseitai saves him. It'll be ok (I can't handle another sign of how shit life has been for<br>Chiaki) 👍<br>He really fucking said “I'm so busy I have to lie to get out of it” what the<br>Fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>Ok its out of my system 😌✌️<br>(breaks a window) I hate these chapters so much<br>Its like I'm watching Chiaki talk about his abusive rl with… life I guess I don't know but it hurts to read<br>❤️❤️❤️ ughhh<br>But at the same time I feel nostalgic of my reaction in 2021 like “ah yeah I was right to be so<br>Upset when reading these chapters back then lmfao”<br>Its always Madara even in !! Era 🤔 I didn't think much about it at the time but now that we<br>Have more context… it goes to show he’s been stuck in the past for so long. He’d always think<br>This way in ! Times too (in halloween he felt incompetent and wanted Madara’s validation)<br>Kanata what’s wrong do you wanna talk about you're feelings for Madara ❤️<br>Love the way Chiaki continues to be the third wheel for these two &lt;3<br>Its interesting how … blinded? But also reasonable? Chiaki’s view of Madara is. Like before<br>Meteor impact came out, we mainly had Chiaki and Kanatas views on what happened in the<br>Past, and Kanata expressed it in a “rogue fucked up and ruined rst” way and Chiaki said it in<br>A “no it was just bad circumstances” way, and would always see the good in Madara<br>In the end when the story came out we come to discover Madara was manipulated and<br>Sabotaged and it led him to take even more hurtful decisions w Kanata<br>So Chiaki is right in a way to see Madara in good light.<br>At the same time, he always sees himself as inferior to Madara… since iirc Madara was the<br>Vice president and w.O Madara, the ex Ryuseitai members would never listen, so ig he always felt<br>Lower than him<br>So in a way Chiaki’s reasonable w how he treats Madara but very very blinded by his low self-esteem that he doesn't uh…? Ig realize, maybe? That Madara is… way too fucked up in the<br>Head to help him lmao 😭 like how tf could Madara help you in your toku show dilemma here!?!<br>Trying to understand the logic but idgi… maybe I'm missing something from Chiaki’s perspective…<br>Anyway please bring back honorifics I can't handle Chiaki calling Madara without -san /j<br>I swear to god at this point Chiaki is just determined to have as many unhealthy rls with ppl<br>As possible /almost j almost srs<br>Thank god he’s snapped out of it eventually<br>The events in !! really strained him so much… he’s so desperate<br>Not to lose everything I cant<br>Uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh awkward<br>Chiaki I don't know how to say this but I dont think they took what you said well ❤️<br>Like where do I even begin w this anyway… Chiaki truly does not understand his importance<br>And relevance in the unit at all. Even tho Kanata would always try to tell him…<br>Shakes him soo much ughhh<br>He really fucking said “oh dw Kanata you're the only person I will never strain<br>Myself with hahaha isnt that so sweet ❤️ we’re so close and bonded that I can do that<br>With you while I strain my soul being a hero to everyone else” enough. Do not pass go<br>I truly do not like these chapters so much they tortured me on the first read and tbh I had<br>Been avoiding them since I can’t stand to read Chiakis unhealthy relationship with<br>Heroism I really cant<br>But also its fascinating how the chapters where Chiaki feels safe because he’s talking to Kanata, his<br>Comfort zone, and he’s very relaxed and the convo is paced to his comfort level…<br>Are actually soooooooo much more painful to read than the chapters where Midori bites back<br>And makes him feel anxious and have no breathing space to respond “appropriately”<br>Lmaoo<br>And they’re only like…? 5 chapters-ish in total between Kanata and Chiaki? Yet they hurt a<br>Lot…<br>Just… being subjected to hearing Chiaki talk about so many red flags and exhibit just as<br>Much, and be satisfied that he at least got to let Kanata know all this is so… what the fuck lol<br>Woops broke my thread I’ll repost in relation to this tweet:<br>I mean I know he says this because he's sooo desperate to keep everything<br>Hes built up safe and secure, but he's also insane for saying that so<br>Casually like… what. Huh<br>Shakes him soo much ughhh<br>He really fucking said “oh dw Kanata you're the only<br>Person I will never strain myself with hahaha isnt<br>That so sweet we’re so close and bonded that I can do<br>That with you while I strain my soul being a hero to everyone<br>Else” enough. Do not pass go<br>Kanata keeping in touch with who he is as a person even as he grows up to be an adult…<br>Whereas Chiaki struggles to maintain who he is as a person as he enters the adult world<br>………… Hate it here<br>… Its even worse cuz Chiaki literally vented to Jin before about his fears of possibly<br>Growing to hate his hobbies when he's older<br>But then it ends with this that makes me feel like even Kanata didn't know at the time that<br>Things will change for both of them (not just Chiaki) and help lessen this feeling of distance<br>And “subjected to the reality of the adult world”…<br>Like Kanata still didn't have his revelation about Shinobu and Tetora yet, and didn't tell them<br>Hes a god yet (out of fear of being hated) so he still… didn't know… he can be saved too …<br>Oh he is soooooo baby he is sooooo cute superest duperest baby actually<br>I still feel like they phrased the first dialogue wrong… it’s just not the right tenses<br>But also Chiaki please<br>Narration: he doesn't know he becomes the girlfriend that makes bentos<br>Holds in the urge to break another window<br>Chiaki please… Its okay its okay to not be “the perfect example of an adult” I'm so<br>Hes just repeating the same problem w heroism<br>Its like he’s so scared that he has to just be an adult and can't ever be his “youthful” self (or<br>Else he’ll be disappointing ppl around him) that he further pushes himself to do “adult-like”<br>Things like “adults drink black coffee right!”<br>He is sooooooo babyyyyyyyyyyy you can talk about toku all you want ❤️❤️❤️<br>❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ baby. Babu. Squishes his cheeks<br>The way Chiakis idol story 1 continues to be relevant to this day (even with the latest stories)<br>Is really impressive… this was a similar issue he vented in that story<br>Once again the agency denies him from pursuing his dreams (stuntwork, suit actor) because it<br>Could harm his idol face or waste it away… all that matters to the agency and sometimes even<br>The public is the face… the surface… the front. The image<br>Everything that tortures Chiaki<br>Engstars you're grammar I’m begging<br>But yeah…<br>And Midori’s going thru something similar too in his field of work… it’s really no coincidence<br>Both of their arcs relate a lot to fans perception/views huh…<br>Ah wait and this is the sort of socmed posts Midori found…? Uhhhh…<br>That sure explains a lot huh ❤️<br>I was gonna comment on this but Kanata did it for me lmao yeah thats just you're form of<br>Justice Chiaki and thats ok.<br>Uuweh… with supervillains now… this hits<br>Hard<br>Since I wanted to double check if he ever says kids in Comet Show… I checked jp its just a -<br>Tachi (lit. Nagumo and the others)<br>…<br>Ugh… I'm just… all of this… ending of Comet Show…<br>Supervillain… even submarine… I can’t…<br>Everything mattered… every step<br>All of it was for that happy ending Chiaki wanted<br>Chiaki wanted a happy ending that didn't require suffering<br>But what we learn is that the happy ending can only be acquired by going thru that pain…<br>You can’t avoid it. The more you do, the farther you stray from the happiest ending<br>He tried so hard to cancel it out, to be the scapegoat of the pain so that all is left is happiness<br>But by doing so, he didn't make anyone happy. because everyone loves him and wants him happy<br>With him. Hah… I'm fine…<br>Im so glad supervillain came out before engstars Comet Show…<br>Ah… I remember this part really hurting a lot on my first read<br>Bc of what Chiaki says at the end here<br>But now I get it a lot better… the eccentrics were also scapegoats . They werent actual villains,<br>But within the script, they were<br>Either way tho, Kanatas trying to say that Chiaki can be selfish and conduct in a manner that<br>May hurt someone but it matters a lot to him to express what he wants to express<br>In other words… to be human<br>But also to be proud/confident of being a human being<br>Which is what eichi and rinne had. They were desperate and they were willing to sacrifice, but<br>Most of all they had a pride and dream and wanted to see it through no matter what<br>Still tho, putting it in the words of being a “villain” wouldnt be clear for Chiaki<br>So he didn't understand Kanata and tbh neither did I at the time lol goes to show<br>Im a Chiakip first and foremost tbh<br>And if anything, Kanatas basically saying to “join” his world a little, every once in a while…<br>Since the two still sort of live in separate worlds<br>Is how I feel but I don't know 🤔 its possible this still has more exploration to it in future stories, since<br>Kanata’s building up to be “the monster of justice” within ryuseitai<br>Wao it never gets old<br>The socmed shit is insane bc<br>This is the context before it<br>Tetora talks about both. Bothhhh<br>And then Midori just immediately zooms in on Chiaki like yeah about him— wtf is wrong with<br>U ?<br>Like… its not even subtext he is literally specifically searching about /Chiaki/<br>I feel like its relevant to an extent that Midori mentioned he muted his name and ryuseitai in<br>Socmed but not about other member’s names tbh… but we’ll see and that is not particularly<br>Related to Comet Show rn<br>Ahhh I always always found this part sooo fascinating… how Midori’s the one out of the 3 who<br>Instantly goes “actually I kinda get their(Chiakis) pov tho” while the other 2 feel upset about it<br>(to the point even Shinobu was)<br>Ahh this part is… …<br>Symbolically, it’s like Chiaki (and Kanata) were going to “die” and leave behind their<br>Cherished ones. And the reason they are is because the agency felt Ryuseitai n (rst trio’s hard work)<br>Wasn’t good enough.<br>It’s like Chiaki’s affirming that it’s so true that he needs to completely cease to exist so that<br>He’s not factored anymore<br>This isn’t like repayfes, where they’re inheriting something and their seniors graduate and<br>Leave<br>This is literally just, ok guess you're on you're own fr bye ✌️<br>This chapter alone could have so many thoughts I don’t even know where to begin tbh<br>Like here how Midori immediately logically goes about this in the “thats what a hero(‘s mask)<br>Would do, the hero is meant to solve issues and thats what the hero is trying to do rn”<br>Anyway they really felt abandoned huh I feel like I can really get all their feelings now in the first<br>Half… on my first read I was like “well this makes sense even if I'm not sure how exactly” but<br>Now I'm just ah… yeah… of course itd hurt. of course this is nothing like repayfes to them</p><p>And thats why Midori hated the way it was compared to it later down the line but I will wait<br>That thought out until I get there<br>I remember feeling really annoyed that Comet Show didn't show us the actual conversation<br>That took place when the agency ordered them around, and how we're just hearing what<br>Happened through &quot;He said she said&quot;, but honestly…<br>I see now why we don't need to see that scene<br>Idk how to explain it but… It doesn't really matter how that scene went. All that matters is<br>How it made the chars feel. How they all responded to it after the fact<br>Also bc.. Based on Ryuseitai trio's reaction, I think it would have frustrated us as well to see how<br>Chiaki acted then<br>Also because I think akira wanted to explore Chiaki's &quot;Approaching everything with logic&quot; traits in a<br>Different way and so he didn't waste his time writing a scene that wouldn't really significantly<br>Express it the same way it was expressed in, say, submarine or supervillain<br>Also it really goes to show how much Kanata loves Chiaki because he doesn't even agree with a<br>Single thing Chiaki is doing rn, and was subtly working towards sabotaging his plan to leave,<br>But still did what he's best at doing as Chiaki's cherished comrade: be by his side<br>So even tho Ryuseitai trio is saying &quot;Both of them&quot; in reality it's only Chiaki in the end (well we knew<br>That lol) but like… Kanata is sort of &quot;Sacrificing&quot; the positive way Ryuseitai trio see him because he'd<br>Rather be by Chiaki's side than have him decide that all on his own<br>I think also this is still pre-submarine so Kanata still felt more connected to Chiaki than the<br>Other three<br>But by the end of Comet Show and even further into submarine, he feels much more<br>Connected with the other three until they are on par with Chiaki<br>So he takes more risks in just leaving Chiaki on his own<br>(also because submarine forced Chiaki to be away from Ryuseitai but yeah)<br>In fact that's… Literally what he did in Comet Show lmao left him on his own with Midori so<br>That Chiaki could no longer have him as backup<br>But I will keep those thoughts for those chapters!!! I'm getting ahead of<br>Myself because ugh the first half is such a good build up to the rest of this story holy shit…</p></div><footer class="post-footer"></footer></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy; <span itemprop="copyrightYear">2025</span> <span class="with-love"><i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i> </span><span class="author" itemprop="copyrightHolder">Unlimited Galaxy</span></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animejs@3.2.1/lib/anime.min.js" integrity="sha256-XL2inqUJaslATFnHdJOi9GfQ60on8Wx1C2H8DYiN1xY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/comments.js"></script><script src="/js/utils.js"></script><script src="/js/motion.js"></script><script src="/js/next-boot.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-generator-searchdb@1.4.0/dist/search.js" integrity="sha256-vXZMYLEqsROAXkEw93GGIvaB2ab+QW6w3+1ahD9nXXA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/third-party/search/local-search.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quicklink@2.2.0/dist/quicklink.umd.js" integrity="sha256-4kQf9z5ntdQrzsBC3YSHnEz02Z9C1UeW/E9OgnvlzSY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script class="next-config" data-name="quicklink" type="application/json">{"enable":true,"home":true,"archive":false,"delay":true,"timeout":3000,"priority":true,"ignores":"/\\/categories\\/?/, /\\/tags\\/?/,","url":"https://unlimited-galaxy.github.io/comet_show/"}</script><script src="/js/third-party/quicklink.js"></script></body></html>
